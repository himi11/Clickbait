talking heads and the police among countless others the legacy of the club which closed in 2006 over a rent dispute is on display in a new movie that stars alan rickman as bemused owner hilly kristal its a bit of a departure for anyone more accustomed to seeing rickman 67 play sinister severus snape in harry potter or judge turpin in sweeney todd the movie also afforded him the opportunity to reunite with fellow hogwarts alum rupert grint who portrays onethird of derrierebearing punk band the dead boys alongside justin bartha and bronson adams theyre joined by a revolving door of notable faces including malin akerman as debbie harry taylor hawkins as iggy pop johnny galecki as terry ork and ashley greene as hillys daughter lisa huffpost entertainment snagged some phone time with rickman and grint who were candid about their unfamiliarity with cbgbs legacy but effusive about the excitement that came with reconvening for the project plus grint talks about his own punk phase and rickman explains what halloween used to mean for him what are you up to today rickman im in new york im just here for three or four days for cbgb in new york and then back to work in england grint im rehearsing a play that will start in london in a couple of weeks yeah so thats it are you enjoying the theater work are you more of a theater guy or a film guy grint i don ’ t know really this is my first theater experience and it ’ s very different i wanted to just try it it ’ s something i ’ ve always wanted to do just the thought of it scares me i ’ ve kind of put it off for a long time and i just thought it was a good time to do it and it ’ s a great play and a really great cast with a great director and it was just yeah i ’ m enjoying it were you familiar with the legacy of cbgb as a breeding ground for the punkrock scene prior to taking your roles in the movie rickman i wasn ’ t familiar with cbgb at all i didn ’ t know about it and didn ’ t know its history i hadn ’ t even really heard those four letters put together because at that time i was very much in england as a drama student and an art student so it ’ s all been a new discovery to me obviously i was aware of some of the bands but not that they ’ d all started in a club on the bowery grint i didnt actually know a lot about it id obviously heard of the name and the logo and seen it on tshirts and stuff like that but i didn ’ t really know how prolific it was in discovering some of my favorite bands i love talking heads and the whole punk thing was something i really loved so yeah it was quite an education learning about it and also dead boys i wasn ’ t really familiar with them and kind of listening and watching them on youtube was amazing they just had so much energy and they were just disgusting it was incredible did you grow up listening to the music depicted in the movie rickman obviously i was aware of the huge rise of the police in england and as an art student i was very much a fan of talking heads and then blondie but i wasn ’ t a hard punkrock fan at the time but of course i was also very much around the height of the beatles and the stones so it was like that was the lone star and everything spun off from there and bob dylan very much so england in the ‘ 60s and the ‘ 70s was everything that history has said it was phenomenally exciting musically one was very shaped by that grint it was that whole era that i liked i like obviously the sex pistols and the clash blondie as well and the ramones some amazing people performed on that stage i went through a real punk phase not that long ago and yeah it was probably the reason why i decided to do it because i have such a love for that did you dress similarly to the character that you play at any point grint laughs no not at all the dog collar was a new experience for me not knowing much of the mythology of cbgb how did you come to learn about your characters rickman what i really enjoyed and what made it interesting to play was the fact that he happened in direct contrast to the world of the club and what its history became because there was this big quiet contained man who made a club for country music and it never ever played there along came punk and he became like that deus ex machina i suppose i watched old interviews and dvds i listened to him talking to his mother and his daughter and journalists so there was a lot of material for me grint yeah there wasn ’ t really a whole lot to go on there are a few videos of him playing live at cbgb and a few interviews i watched yeah and having dead boys guitarist cheetah chrome on set was quite a different thing i had kind of a little bit of pressure because he was kind of watching every scene and you ’ re trying to portray him and do him justice and it ’ s quite a challenge so he was on set the whole time grint yeah he has a cameo he plays the cab driver he was lovely he was such a nice guy i was kind of surprised he was still alive did he give you any notes while filming grint not so much notes it was just kind of watching him and being around him and listening to his stories and just listening really kind of absorbing a lot of that and he was such a nice guy and we had a good time was this movie your first instance of nudity on camera grint yeah i guess it was yeah were you comfortable with that how did that go down grint weirdly yeah it didn ’ t really feel that big a deal it just kind of happened i didn ’ t really think about it when i was getting ready for it and yeah it just kind of happened i had some sort of sock modesty thing contraption i don ’ t want to go into too much detail and yeah it was just sort of one of those things there was quite a lot of that in the film especially from justin bartha as well there ’ s quite a lot of ass in the film you had to try out an american accent in this role is there an accent out there that youd be intimidated to have to use on camera rickman i think every english actor is nervous of a newcastle accent that ’ s really difficult grint it ’ s quite fun just trying to work on it and get it right i like that kind of challenge a couple years ago i did a film that required me to do a liverpool accent i don ’ t know if you ’ re familiar with that sound but that was quite a hard one it ’ s quite a harsh sound but i enjoy that side of things once you started exploring the role and got into the dead boys and their history did you find yourself enjoying their music what did you think of the band you were portraying grint i really love them i listened to all their songs completely their songs are quite hard to play not easy to listen to but no i really love then i ’ ve always really wanted to be in a band so this was kind of an opportunity to experience that to go on stage and have the whole crowd there and the music is music something you ’ d ever pursue grint i don ’ t know probably not i ’ ve tried to leverage it but i just know it ’ s never going to happen alan you often play very dominant roles very powerful people what were your thoughts going into a character who was much more loosegoosey is it fun to shift gears and play that sort of character rickman i suppose in my perspective i ’ ve played as many of those as i have the other sort it ’ s just some get more publicity or make more money at the box office or something i ’ m perfectly happy to be colonel brandon in sense sensibility as i am any of those powerful characters it ’ s just part of an actor ’ s job and you just alter the colors that you get out of the cupboard how was it to reunite had you seen each other since doing press for the eighth harry potter movie rickman no because i think we ’ d both been so busy doing other things but it was great to see him on the set and it was great to watch all three of them i saw emma watson the other night in london in a restaurant and i saw daniel radcliffe recently in london because he was doing a play it ’ s great to watch the three of them moving forward into the rest of their lives and being working actors and not trapped by one image grint not really no actually i love alan he ’ s always been one of my favorites but yeah it was quite weird seeing him in a whole new kind of environment because i ’ m trying to think back i don ’ t think i ever really saw him outside of that wig and cloak which potter costar would you most like to reunite with grint there are so many all of them i ’ ve already loved working with them i like michael gambon he ’ s so cool just a remarkable guy i ’ ve worked with julie walters before as well i love her she ’ s great now for something more fun its october whats your favorite halloween costume youve ever worn rickman laughs the thing about halloween is to me it just means because it ’ s so different in england – we used to have something called bonfire night and we ’ d have fireworks that ’ s disappeared and i know halloween ’ s taken over halloween to me as a child was the family would fill a bowl of water and you ’ d have apple bobbing in it and you ’ d get apples out of a bowl of water to me it just means a soaking wet shirt grint i liked halloween it never used to be a big thing when i was kid we never really did it but i actually had a good costume not that long ago the last one i dressed as a playdoh can that i made you know playdoh of course grint well literally i actually made it it was a yellow bin i cut the bottom out and i just wore a yellow bin with a playdoh logo with a yellow hat it ’ s not very practical do you have a favorite halloween candy rickman i don ’ t even know what that means the word chocolate would loom large grint a favorite halloween candy i don ’ t really know i never trickortreated when i was younger because we lived on a block of houses that were all just kind of elderly people who were just scared to answer the door but yeah candy corn that ’ s a big thing i ’ ve tried that that ’ s pretty great cbgb is

we got a call and it was thenmavericks coach don nelson he was like hey we just drafted you guys wed love to come over and see you guys because i had said that i wasnt sure if i was coming to the nba or not i was like this is crazy after the whole hoop summit i guess there was a little hype but i never thought somebody would take a chance on me that high especially after saying that i wasnt sure if i would come or not worried about basically going from the second division to the nba that was a huge jump and i was a little worried it was bizarre whoa dallas took a chance on me at frickin no 9 it was incredible then mavericks gm donnie nelson and nellie came maybe a couple of days later they showed up in wurzburg thenmavericks owner ross perot came in the private plane i had this press conference in this small little hotel that ill never forget it was unbelievable i remember like maybe two or three media people showed up because it was on such short notice right ross was the one who wanted the press conference but we couldnt even get a tv station there there was literally like three people there it was so bizarre so bizarre whoa dallas took a chance on me at frickin no 9 it was incredible dirk nowitzki on his reaction to being drafted by the mavs in 1998 then ross flew out again and donnie and nellie stayed for a few days and talked to me over and over they said hey dont make a decision before we fly you to dallas we want you to see everything and meet some of the guys so i agreed to that i flew back with donnie and holger stayed at nellies house back in the day had a press conference never had a suit so i remember right from the airport we went right to lombardos custom apparel in dallas i had the worst jacket on and we had a press conference thats when i met nashie steve nash for the first time because they flew him in for the press conference it kind of clicked from there i think on my second night nellie threw a little barbecue at his house for me and fin michael finley came and strick erick strickland came nashie was there and some of the other guys who were in town i just got to mingle a little bit and meet them and speak as much as i could with my english then the next night was our decision they set a press conference the morning before i left and nellie was like think about it all night but we need a decision before you leave so that night was rough i remember i was sitting with holger around the pool for hours obviously i had concerns i had concerns about making that huge jump id never lived anywhere but with my parents i guess the end of the story was well try they had a young team it wasnt like they were a great team right then not really a playoff team so you could get some minutes and develop nellie said at the end of the day if things dont work out you could always go back to europe thats always an option after two or three years when your contract is over if they dont take the option after three years youre back home in europe so the next day i went to the press conference and was like ill try pierce i remember slipping and not really knowing where i was going to end up because i only worked out for the top five teams i remember i didnt know who jason williams was and he got drafted ahead of me it was just weird i thought id be in the top five and i slipped all the way to 10 so it was a strange night for me and then i go to boston a team i really didnt like growing up because i was a lakers fan but you know things happen for a reason i guess it was meant for me to be in boston it worked out ok carter you finally get to the draft after working out for five or six teams and its the unexpected we knew either bibby or olowokandi was going one or two and then after that its all hearsay i heard anywhere from three to eight thats what i hear so you kind of have to hang your hat on that unless you get that phone call ok were going to get you if youre available i just remember sitting around olowokandi ok bibby ok raef lafrentz great from there you really didnt know i remember sitting at the table next to me was antawn jamison our families were sitting next to each other laughing and talking i remember saying man what do you think is going to happen we had no idea they called antawn at four i mean he was my suitemate in college and very good friends so i was over the moon it felt like i got drafted because i was just nervous and excited for him as if it was me but the weird thing about it at the time was that he never worked out for toronto so it was kind of like ok well they just really wanted him i worked out for them and toronto told me basically if youre available were going to go get you so you might as well come work out thats what we were hearing so i took my workout and everything i was introduced to the business of basketball pretty much in the first five minutes i was on the west coast back to the east coast in a matter of five minutes vince carter on being traded from golden state to toronto on draft night but then they drafted him so i was just perplexed a little bit like wait a minute what the hecks going on here but nevertheless i was excited for him and like whatever you know youre just living in the moment then i started looking around when the camera starts getting close to you you figure theyre talking about you this could be it you try to play it cool then i get the phone call like right before and they call your name and it was just over the moon i remember getting my hat from hat lady chrysa chin and then im walking up the steps and as im walking i see antawn at the bottom of the steps still i was like hey whats up as soon as i took the picture david stern says to me wait right here theres about to be a trade well go from there ok i step back im holding my hat looking at it the first thing i said is dang somebodys getting traded already on draft night dang it it was me and it all came together well antawn i guess got the word that there was going to be a trade thats why he was sitting there i didnt know because of course by the time it was happening i was already walking up to the stage it blindsides me pretty much but then it all made sense i was introduced to the business of basketball pretty much in the first five minutes i was on the west coast back to the east coast in a matter of five minutes mind you everybody at their tables had their hat fixed perfectly basically heres your hat to that table heres your hat to this table it was a pretty cool thing not only did jamison and i get to experience the draft beside each other but we got traded for each other as well so it was pretty cool nowitzki vince just had unbelievable athleticism i mean he did stuff that i dont think weve seen before in this league i was in oakland at his dunk contest in 2000 and nobodys ever seen the stuff that he did but what kept him so long in the league now was really his skill level even though obviously he still has some athleticism still has some hops but its his shot the repertoire of fadeaways that hes got his 3ball was always money and hes a big guy for a 2 or 3 that was always good on the block hed run a pickandroll going to his right where he was always deadly i mean he was a tough matchup because he could post and he was so freakishly athletic hed come off a down pick and just jump up and really nobody could get to his shot obviously hes so athletic that once he got going to the rim you could challenge him but he was going to put you on a poster he was fun to watch during his prime pierce he had unique ability something you hardly see great athleticism and great shooting touch usually you see one without the other he had the combination of both thats rare its something this league has not seen in a long time pierce dirk changed the game man when you look at what he was able to bring with his versatility and his shooting as a 7footer to be able to put the ball on the ground he was one of the first stretch 4s that you see more of today i mean he revolutionized the game players like that are transcendent he was a transcendent player carter first of all his work ethic he puts a lot of time in and its different than any other player ive ever seen ive been around long enough to see a lot of guys train and prepare but he just loves the game he loves to play he loves to compete and hes selfless hes all about the good of the team thats one thing having the opportunity to play with a goto guy a superstar like himself is that hes willing to make the right play its not always like the play is for me i have to make the shot the play is for me i have to make the right play thats his mentality but when he wants the ball hes going to say give me the ball hes a professional scorer i say this about myself too and you could probably say it about paul as well when you see him walk into the arena before a game you could probably say theres no way in hell that those guys are playing tonight then dirk will come in and drop 35 regardless of how he feels before the game once the big lights are on and you come on the court he knows how to get it done plain and simple nowitzki he was strong hed get to his spots he was a clutch shooter he definitely had the clutch gene great pump fake could get to the foul line i mean he was the complete package from the small forward standpoint you put a smaller guy on him he was able to post and shoot over him could drive both ways even ran some pickandrolls and when it mattered he made big shots i wouldnt say he was a great flatout 3point shooter but when the game was on the line you never really wanted him shooting the 3 he was a competitor and really just a great allaround player carter he was a killer hes been like that since high school i remember us playing against each other in the mcdonalds allamerican game and just being around each other hes always had the mentality to score and wanted to dominate while having the ability to do whatever he wanted he had the big body and he knew how to use it there are some people who are big and strong but they dont use it like that paul used it and he was deceptively quick so when he got the ball in the logo area and he would swing through and put his body on you you just hope he missed ive had many many many great battles against him and know him very well of course we all know paul can shoot the heck out of the basketball from the 3point line hes just another professional scorer nowitzki i was always the young guy the german wunderkind the young guy coming up with talent it felt like the next thing you know i was 30 those years just flew by youre having fun youre competing every year and then in the summer its not like i was just sitting on my butt in my 20s i played national team every year so literally i took like two weeks off and then was right back in the gym working with holger if you stay busy time flies so my 20s i felt like they were over in a heartbeat next thing you know youre 30 and youre sort of like a midaged guy couple of young guys but still a couple older guys then the last few years youre just the oldest guy its amazing how 19 years just have flown by but if you stay busy if you have a blast now im still trying to compete i enjoy doing it obviously its not as easy as back in the day all the extra work you have to put in to stay ready now dealing with injuries that i really never had it takes the fun away a little bit but hopefully i can stay healthy and have fun pierce oh its fun im enjoying every moment shootaround im enjoying the bus rides the plane rides with the guys im enjoying every last bit of camaraderie that im going to get with my team in the locker room on the court im just soaking it all in ive been around this game for a long time a lot of plane rides a lot of bus rides a lot of pregame speeches a lot of national anthems im enjoying the ride man i know this is the last year so im enjoying it as much as i can carter im a little uneasy sometimes some days im ok with it i know its near and im preparing myself for it but some days im like man im not ready to walk away from it because i still enjoy being in the gym i still enjoy running around and competing and laughing and joking theres nothing better when youve done this so long its all you know maybe not all i know but all ive done and all ive enjoyed doing at this point now im prepared to move on to phase 2 but its kind of like you do all the preparation to be prepared but youre not prepared if that makes sense i remember seeing all of the other guys with the raptors seeing oak charles oakley and antonio davis and kevin willis and hakeem olajuwon watching them in their final years then they stepped out in the world and were just kind of like where do i go from here i mean those guys were prepared its something i never really thought about until im going to say five years ago just making sure im ready because you hear the stories about guys who step out into the world when they retire and its like all right i have some money in my pocket where do i go then just spending and spending and you hear the next horror story that they go broke thats something that i vow never to do for me an idle mind is just awful i think id be a miserable person and id get on a lot of peoples nerves if im retired and i have nothing to do i cant just sit around people are like oh you get to retire and go to all these countries and visit i cant do that thats not who i am im not a vacation guy like that i wouldnt like it i know that so id have to find something to do thats where phase 2 started years ago as far as kind of introducing myself to different people and figuring out what im really passionate about the coaching thing is still up in the air i get asked about it all the time i enjoy it but i dont know if i want to do it its just the weirdest thing i guess it makes sense but to me it still doesnt make sense how is it that you enjoy it have been doing it all these years but can see yourself coaching full time i really cant see myself as a coach as of right now in the broadcasting world i can see it clear as day im still fighting with that other than that im ready to go when the time is right theres some mornings i wake up and its like is it one more year or is it this year or is it three years i can never decide on a number scary it really is for me because i love this game and i dont want to leave it not yet nowitzki heavy sigh that sounds like a lot but you know hopefully i can stay out there and i can score a few vince has been on a tear for a while and paul i dont think is playing much but you know were going to try all three of us are competitors i think as you get older its more important to be on a winning team im sure vince is enjoying that the grizzlies are playing well and paul is enjoying the clippers we need some work pierce its going to be tough its not looking good im not playing much our only chance is vince carter now dirk has been hurt but who knows man weve got a shot weve got a shot but i think lebron james dwyane wade and carmelo anthony are going to crush it lebron wade and melo are coming and theyre coming fast carter its possible its possible i mean god willing with health of course and opportunity i think its possible if we stay healthy dirk wants to play another year and with his ability to score hes going to get touches im putting all of the pressure on him',\n",

              " 'Summarize:condition: shower habits you need to stop doing immediately paragraph: did you know theres actually a right way to shower get ready turn down that water temperature and drop the shampoo here are the things you need to stop doing while showering showering is—and should be—a daily habit for most of us and everyone has their own routine some people can ’ t live without washing their hair each day while others chose to skip a day or two and the differences continue on from there however did you know that some of the most common shower habits might not actually be that healthy believe it or not some of the things you do every day while taking a shower could be affecting you in ways you ’ ve never thought of check out this list to see if your shower habits are doing you more harm than good 1 washing your face without a doubt it ’ s easier and less messy to wash your face when you ’ re already in the shower however despite the convenience it ’ s actually not good for your face the water that you shower in will typically be much hotter than what you ’ d wash with at the sink and the high temperature can make your skin dry out very quickly those with skin conditions such as acne or rosacea may also find that washing their face with hot water can cause excessive redness and irritation—it could even burst a blood vessel in your face if you wash too aggressively use a gentle cleanser and avoid washing your face in the shower particularly if you have acneprone skin or rosacea 2 not washing your feet you might be thinking that your feet make contact with plenty of water while you ’ re in the shower so there ’ s no real reason to actually bend down and give them a proper wash you ’ d be wrong though even if you ’ re not prone to smelly feet think about how sweaty your feet can get throughout the day not only that but if you ’ re known to walk around the house or outdoors without socks or shoes you never know what you might be picking up along the way there ’ s no excuse for just letting the soap suds run down to your toes anymore—imagine what you ’ re bringing into your bed every night without giving those feet a good wash 3 not washing or replacing your loofah regularly be honest how long has the same loofah been hanging in your shower months years as it turns out that can be terrible for your health this video demonstrates why consider treating yourself to a new sponge or loofah the next time you ’ re out or create a cute and convenient place to hang the one you have for air drying 4 using a soap dish yes that builtin soap dish is there forever but using it for its intended purpose actually isn ’ t that good of an idea the majority of people don ’ t use bars of soap these days but for those who do be aware that leaving a bar of soap in one spot could be encouraging bacteria to grow on it—bacteria that you ’ re then going to spread over your entire body the next time you lather up if you have reasons for resisting the switch to liquid body wash try finding a wire soap dish or one that has holes in the bottom so any remaining water can drain away once you ’ re out of the shower 5 using scented soaps yes those soaps that make your bathroom smell like a tropical rainforest or a freshlymade vanilla cupcake do transport you to a place of olfactory luxury while sudsing up but those very fragrances could be doing a number on your skin at the same time anyone who notices their skin seems particularly irritated after a shower should look to their soap as the first culprit fragrances can irritate sensitive skin very easily so it ’ s best to use something unscented to keep your skin in the best shape plus you won ’ t have to worry about the scent of your soap mixing with the scent of your perfume to create questionable smells 6 showering in hard water some people may not even know how to tell if their water is considered hard but figuring it out and taking steps to adjust it could save your hair and skin from a lot of damage hard water is defined by its high concentration of minerals like magnesium and calcium which can end up making your skin break out or cause a layer of buildup on your hair those with dyed hair may even find that hard water strips the color out of their strands or at least causes their tint to fade a little quicker if you ’ re unable to add a water softener to your shower try incorporating a clarifying shampoo into your routine to remove any buildup caused by those pesky minerals 7 avoiding cold showers most people wouldn ’ t even dream of standing in cold water for more than a second let alone taking an entire shower in water that ’ s anything less than steaming hot still cold water showers can actually be really beneficial for your skin and hair and you only need 30 seconds under a cold stream to see a difference a quick blast of cold water is said to improve your immune function increase your metabolism and increase the amount of stress you can tolerate in addition to speeding up your metabolism a study done in 2009 suggests that regularly taking a cold shower could even help you lose weight over time 8 using old razors for most of us old razors aren ’ t something we thoughtfully replace on a regular basis instead they just sit in the shower until we finally cave and get a new one razors whether you ’ re buying replacement heads or the kind that are entirely disposable are surprisingly expensive—so why throw one out after a certain period of time if it still seems to work well just because a razor is shaving off your unwanted hairs doesn ’ t mean it ’ s doing so effectively if you notice that your skin gets red and inflamed after you shave it ’ s because the blades are dull and it ’ s time for a replacement 9 leaving your razor in the shower remember how leaving your wet bar of soap in your dingy old soap dish makes it a breeding ground for bacteria the same thing goes for your razor there are plenty of nooks and crannies in your razor that make perfect spots for bacteria to hide and the problem will only get worse when the razor is sitting in a warm wet environment if you don ’ t actually want to store your razor outside of the shower at least make sure that you hang it up when you ’ re done using it so it can air dry 10 over exfoliating giving your skin a gentle scrub every now and then is a good idea but doing so every day could actually be causing damage for anyone who doesn ’ t know your skin actually exfoliates itself by renewing every 27 days or so anyone who chooses to exfoliate their skin every day is aggressively going after fresh skin cells which can make your skin red and irritated as a result it ’ s best to let some dead cells build up on the surface of your skin before reaching for your favorite scrub so that you know there ’ s actually something there worth exfoliating',\n",
              " 'Summarize:condition: what it feels like to die paragraph: do you want to know what will happen as your body starts shutting down my mother and i sat across from the hospice nurse in my parents ’ colorado home it was 2005 and my mother had reached the end of treatments for metastatic breast cancer a month or two earlier she ’ d been able to take the dog for daily walks in the mountains and travel to australia with my father now she was weak exhausted from the disease and chemotherapy and pain medication my mother had been the one to decide with her doctor ’ s blessing to stop pursuing the dwindling chemo options and she had been the one to ask her doctor to call hospice still we weren ’ t prepared for the nurse ’ s question my mother and i exchanged glances a little shocked but what we felt most was a sense of relief during sixandahalf years of treatment although my mother saw two general practitioners six oncologists a cardiologist several radiation technicians nurses at two chemotherapy facilities and surgeons at three different clinics—not once to my knowledge had anyone talked to her about what would happen as she died there ’ s good reason roughly from the last two weeks until the last breath somewhere in that interval people become too sick or too drowsy or too unconscious to tell us what they ’ re experiencing says margaret campbell a professor of nursing at wayne state university who has worked in palliative care for decades the way death is talked about tends to be based on what family friends and medical professionals see rather than accounts of what dying actually feels like james hallenbeck a palliativecare specialist at stanford university often compares dying to black holes we can see the effect of black holes but it is extremely difficult if not impossible to look inside them they exert an increasingly strong gravitational pull the closer one gets to them as one passes the ‘ event horizon ’ apparently the laws of physics begin to change what does dying feel like despite a growing body of research about death the actual physical experience of dying—the last few days or moments—remains shrouded in mystery medicine is just beginning to peek beyond the horizon until about 100 years ago almost all dying happened quickly but modern medicine has radically changed how long the end of life can be stretched now americans who have access to medical care often die gradually of lingering diseases like most terminal cancers or complications from diabetes or dementia rather than quickly from say a farm accident or the flu according to the centers for disease control ’ s most recent figures americans are most likely to die of heart disease cancer or chronic pulmonary lung disease predeath dreams were frequently so intense that the dream carried into wakefulness for those who do die gradually there ’ s often a final rapid slide that happens in roughly the last few days of life—a phase known as active dying during this time hallenbeck writes in palliative care perspectives his guide to palliative care for physicians people tend to lose their senses and desires in a certain order first hunger and then thirst are lost speech is lost next followed by vision the last senses to go are usually hearing and touch whether dying is physically painful or how painful it is appears to vary there are some kinds of conditions where pain is inevitable campbell says there are some patients that just get really really old and just fade away and there ’ s no distress having a disease associated with pain doesn ’ t mean you ’ ll necessarily endure a difficult death either most people dying of cancer need pain medication to keep them comfortable campbell notes—and the medicine usually works if they ’ re getting a good comprehensive pain regimen they can die peacefully she says when people become too weak to cough or swallow some start to make a noise in the backs of their throats the sound can be deeply disturbing as if the patient is suffering but that ’ s not what it feels like to the person dying as far as doctors can tell in fact medical researchers believe that the phenomenon—which is commonly called a death rattle—probably doesn ’ t hurt ultimately because most people lose awareness or consciousness in their last few hours or days it ’ s hard to know for certain how much patients are suffering we generally believe that if your brain is really in a comatose kind of situation or you ’ re not really responsive that your perception—how you feel about things—may also be significantly decreased says david hui an oncologist and palliativecare specialist who researches the signs of approaching death you may or may not even be aware of what ’ s happening a week or two after we spoke to the nurse my mother sank into a state where she was rarely conscious when she was awake it was only the most basic part of her that was there the part that told her legs to move to get her to the bathroom the automated steps in brushing her teeth and then wiping the sink afterward her mind turned away from her children and husband for the first time i wanted to know what she was thinking about i wanted to know where her mind was being at the bedside of an unresponsive dying person can feel like trying to find out whether someone is home by looking through thickcurtained windows is the person sleeping dreaming experiencing something supernatural is her mind gone for many dying people the brain does the same thing that the body does in that it starts to sacrifice areas which are less critical to survival says david hovda director of the ucla brain injury research center he compares the breakdown to what happens in aging people tend to lose their abilities for complex or executive planning learning motor skills—and in what turns out to be a very important function inhibition the waves get higher and higher and eventually they carry the person out to sea as the brain begins to change and start to die different parts become excited and one of the parts that becomes excited is the visual system hovda explains and so that ’ s where people begin to see light recent research points to evidence that the sharpening of the senses some people report also seems to match what we know about the brain ’ s response to dying jimo borjigin a neuroscientist at the university of michigan first became intrigued by this subject when she noticed something strange in the brains of animals in another experiment just before the animals died neurochemicals in the brain suddenly surged while scientists had known that brain neurons continued to fire after a person died this was different the neurons were secreting new chemicals and in large amounts a lot of cardiacarrest survivors describe that during their unconscious period they have this amazing experience in their brain she says they see lights and then they describe the experience as ‘ realer than real ’ she realized the sudden release of neurochemicals might help to explain this feeling borjigin and her research team tried an experiment they anesthetized eight rats and then stopped their hearts suddenly all the different regions of the brain became synchronized she says the rats ’ brains showed higher power in different frequency waves and also what is known as coherence—the electrical activity from different parts of the brain working together if you ’ re focusing attention doing something trying to figure out a word or trying to remember a face—when you ’ re doing highlevel cognitive activity these features go up borjigin says these are wellused parameters in studying human consciousness in awake humans so we thought if you ’ re alert or aroused similar parameters should also go up in the dying brain in fact that was the case in her last couple of weeks when my mother ’ s mind seemed to be floating off somewhere else most of the time she would sometimes lift her arms into the air plucking at invisible objects with her fingers once i captured her hands in mine and asked what she ’ d been doing putting things away she answered smiling dreamily this halfdreaming halfwaking state is common in dying people in fact researchers led by christopher kerr at a hospice center outside buffalo new york conducted a study of dying people ’ s dreams most of the patients interviewed 88 percent had at least one dream or vision and those dreams usually felt different to them from normal dreams for one thing the dreams seemed clearer more real the patients ’ predeath dreams were frequently so intense that the dream carried into wakefulness and the dying often experienced them as waking reality the researchers write in the journal of palliative medicine seventytwo percent of the patients dreamed about reuniting with people who had already died fiftynine percent said they dreamed about getting ready to travel somewhere twentyeight percent dreamed about meaningful experiences in the past patients were interviewed every day so the same people often reported dreams about multiple subjects for most of the patients the dreams were

refuse to hire someone fresh out the feds or convicts who are still incarcerated but allowed to get a job through workrelease other prisoners are so shellshocked from being back in a society that changed dramatically while they were locked up that figuring out how to do basic things like use public transportation or a cell phone can feel like a herculean task according to the national institute of justice over 60 percent of excons are jobless up to a year after release that said getting a job is a necessary step for prisoners to integrate back into society often times its a requirement by the criminal justice system or else freshlyreleased inmates will risk being sent back to the feds but even when excons do manage to get hired the work is underpaid demoralizing and their employers dont do much to encourage the reentry process there are organizers that help former prisoners assimilate into the workforce but the support is generally few and far between after serving 23 years in the feds the first job i got on the outside was as a sauté cook at an italian restaurant despite my earning two college degrees while in prison the work sucked and i was forced to do the grunt work no one else would do like clean out the fryers every night i wasnt in any position to argue and risk being canned and my employers took advantage of this i dreaded that job but as ive talked with other excons over the years about their first gigs on the outside i now consider myself lucky the fact that over 75 percent of excons are rearrested within five years of releas e should be no surprise when the only jobs offered to people with criminal records are the gigs no one else applies for vice chatted with three excons to get more perspective on what reentering the workforce was like once they got out of prison image of cattle ranchers via wikimedia creative commons mendoor smith 43yearold from iowa served 12 years for marijuana possession released from custody in 2013 the worst job i had was working on a cattle ranch as a utility farmer making 825 an hour i had to be there from about 6 am to 5 pm every day and the commute was 45 minutes from the halfway house i was placed in it wasnt really tough work but the handling of manure and animals was rough as was taking care of the calves and cows dealing with cows everyday is messy and id have to clean out their living pens i remember calving one shift during the winter and when i did my hourly inspection of the herd i noticed a cow with an extremely bad vaginal prolapse i called my boss and he called the vet who came out at four in the morning i had to lift the cows vaginal insides and hold them while the vet tried to stuff them back inside the cow after about an hour and a half of lifting and stuffing this slimy nasty thing the vet finally got it all back inside and sewed up when i did my final inspection of the morning at 10 am the cow had died all that work was for nothing having to stick my entire arm in a cow to help pull out a calf was not fun either you work super hard to pull one of the slimy things out and then you have to scoop the little thing up and take off before the cow attacks you for holding its calf having a 1200 pound animal chase you is a little intimidating i had two coworkers that knew about my criminal situation they asked a lot of questions stuff about what was prison like and what i did to get all that time my boss was a good boss he helped me get my class a drivers license so i could drive trucks for him he was a big help and was instrumental in me getting the job i have now the farm was a tightknit family so i was treated well but the work was completely horrible it prepared me for the struggle of rebuilding my life after prison though it didnt kill me and it made me stronger that job sucked but i was still glad to have it because i wouldnt be in the position im in today otherwise david hibdon 55yearold from missouri served 10 years for drug conspiracy released from custody in 2014 my first job out of prison was the worst job available in colombia missouri i was picking up trash at the city dump in 100plus degree weather for 8 an hour i had to walk around 27 acres and pick up the trash that blew off the trucks rain or shine some days i walked through raw sewage or mud up to my ankles the halfway house didnt provide transportation to the job and i had to walk there every morning it was a seven mile walk that took over two hours i had to be there at seven in the morning and got off at 4 pm with only a short lunch break in between with my first paycheck i bought a bike and then it only took me forty minutes to get to work i was making about 50 bucks a day but i was required to give 25 percent to the halfway house if i bought a soda or cigarettes i was almost broke it took me two months in the halfway house to save up and buy a 500 car i worked there because it was the only job available nobody wanted the job because of the stink and the dust blowing on you from the trash trucks no one else would take these jobs besides excons at the halfway house and all the other excons that worked there would sleep on a nearby hill or smoke k2 all day while i was working i was alienated out there it was one of the most degrading experiences i ever went through but i got past it it sure didnt help me become a better person cause i was still the same after ive had four jobs since ive been out and i never told anyone i was on parole until after i was hired or they wouldnt have hired me i eventually started my own business subcontracting myself out to do maintenance on rental properties i could go back to the dump if i wanted but that job sucked image of a telemarketing call center via mike vargas 44yearold from washington dc served 14 years for a drug conspiracy released from custody in 2009 it wasnt hard getting a job when i came home it just wasnt a good job i started working the same week i was released at this telemarketing place that hired excons at 725 an hour you had to be there talking to people on the phone all day cold calling trying to collect donations for different organizations around the state and country it was cool at first but after a while i was starting to feel like a robot i worked with mostly young people and there were also a bunch of excons working there anybody could have got hired at this place but the conditions were terrible you had a total of 16 minutes of break time for a full eight hour shift if you went to get a coke you had to clock out if you went to the bathroom you had to clock out if you didnt kiss ass you were an outsider there was a lot of favoritism and also a big turnover within staff of course dudes would curse out the boss one dude even jumped up picked up a computer and slammed it down because he couldnt get anybody to donate he walked out shortly after but most excons needed the job to get out of the halfway house so they just kept working there until something better came along i quit that job when i had something better lined up it served its purpose because if you dont have a gig you have to stay at the halfway ive had like seven or eight jobs since then ive done a lot of different things but that was the worst im a machinist now and i assemble parts all day at a machine its easier and the pay is better but

diagnosed with a serious peanut allergy problem is he won ’ t carry his epipen around with him — because it won ’ t fit into his pocket it ’ s large and it ’ s impractical clark said where ’ s he going to put it this underscores a simple truth epipens just aren ’ t that great they ’ re reliable sure they ’ ll buy a patient who ’ s in the midst of a severe allergic reaction a few crucial minutes to make his way to the hospital but they ’ re also bulky their epinephrine solution isn ’ t particularly shelfstable and will easily degrade in temperatures that are too low or too high they expire after about a year and they ’ re not so userfriendly though epipens come with a practice kit users in the midst of an allergy attack have mistaken which end ’ s the pointy end — and stabbed their thumbs instead of their thighs the devices have come under fire in the past month for their escalating sticker price a pack of two epipens now lists for 608 mylan which owns the epipen brand though the device itself is actually manufactured by pfizer notes that it redesigned the product in 2009 added features including the fliptop case and is investing substantial amounts in research into additional improvements such as a formulation with a longer shelf life but critics say mylan has little incentive to improve epipens if you ’ re the monopolist and you ’ ve got a product that expires every year and it ’ s not super easy to carry around so the safest thing to do is have several tucked away in different places — i don ’ t see why there would be any pressure to innovate said nicholson price an assistant professor at the university of michigan law school who studies health care regulation and patent law epipen ’ s flaws seem like features not a bug price said competitors have tried to make runs at the epipen and more are trying now that there ’ s such a spotlight on the product but it ’ s unclear if anything can displace the familiar autoinjector with the bright orange cap here ’ s why 1 mylan has patent protection that lasts through 2025 epinephrine as a drug was first synthesized more than a century ago it ’ s been used for various medical applications since then and was first packaged in an autoinjector to protect soldiers against chemical warfare back in the 1970s but mylan has a lock on the particular epipen design that millions of patients parents and school nurses have come to trust the company ’ s main innovation has been a bright orange cap that covers the needle but releases automatically when a patient pushes an epipen against her thigh so there ’ s no need to stop and unscrew the cover in the midst of an allergy attack the very fact that the epipen has been dominant for so long makes it hard for challengers to come in with a radically different design mylan is now pledging to make a generic version which it says will be identical except for the label if you ’ re a parent and your child ’ s suffering from an allergic reaction you have to give them an injection — and don ’ t want to read the instructions in that moment said matthew allen head of drug delivery for cambridge consultants you just have to know how to use it allen ’ s work at cambridge consultants centers around designing other forms of autoinjectors he said the food and drug administration has rules to standardize the way these lifesaving devices work those rules keep consumers safe but they also make it difficult to come up with design that can meet the standards — without infringing on mylan ’ s patent it would not be very difficult to create an epipen product in terms of engineering allen said it ’ s not rocket science it ’ s purely the patent that stops us 2 there ’ s no room for error when you ’ re treating anaphylaxis chris stepanian is ceo of windgap medical a boston startup that ’ s been working on a nextgeneration epinephrine autoinjector for the past five years windgap ’ s device is meant to improve upon the epipen it ’ s supposed to be smaller about the size of a bic lighter with a much more stable formulation of epinephrine intended to survive in a pants pocket without getting overheated but that ’ s proving easier said than done stepanian said he ’ s at least a few years away from bringing his newfangled autoinjector to market though epipen components look pretty basic mylan notes that it is made up of 26 parts and must be able to deliver the drug with a sterile needle within seconds stepanian agrees that it ’ s more complicated than it seems at first glance it ’ s really challenging to make a reliable autoinjector — and surprisingly hard to make a combination drug product he said it ’ s a tough thing to nail down the drug supply chain the plastics and design and then incorporate that all together and put the drug inside it — and then regardless of how the user uses it get the appropriate dose within the acceptable limits of the fda stepanian added at least mylan and pfizer have done a good job of making a pretty reliable one one epipen alternative that did make it to market the auviq an epinephrine autoinjector shaped like a bulky credit card but sanofi recalled the devices last year over concerns that patients weren ’ t getting the correct dose every time it returned the commercial and marketing rights to kaleo from whom it licensed the autoinjector in 2009 a representative from kaleo said that it ’ s in the process of evaluating when and how to bring the auviq back to the market — but sanofi is no longer involved 3 it doesn ’ t take an autoinjector to get epinephrine into the body — but it sure helps in the wake of the recent outrage at mylan los angelesbased mannkind corporation announced it ’ s developing an inhalable form of epinephrine we could make something very tiny that you could carry on a keychain — much smaller than an epipen or autoinjector by far mannkind ceo matthew pfeffer said mannkind already has an inhalable insulin product called afrezza on the market which gives diabetics an alternative to injections but it ’ s proved exceedingly tough to get patients to switch from a format of insulin intake they ’ re familiar with to an inhaler sales have been far below expectations the same problem could stymie an epinephrine inhaler especially since one of the frightening features of an anaphylactic attack is that the airways constrict — which in theory anyway could make it hard for a patient to use the inhaler in a moment of crisis 4 the regulatory process is slow and expensive a lot of the challenge lies in the regulatory system said mark baum ceo of san diegobased imprimis — a compound pharmaceutical company that ’ s working on a cheaper alternative to the epipen it can take a long time and a lot of money to get fda approval for a new product the only time it makes economic sense to take the risk of going through these clinical trials is when you have a situation like this baum said but when the market was more normalized — when the epipen was only retailing around 100 — competitors questioned whether it was worth taking that risk public anger at epipen is so high right now that baum figures it is worth taking the risk imprimis has had its eyes on the epinephrine autoinjector market for about two years now it ’ s finally going to go for it we ’ re just focused on being that competition he said 5 the public hasn ’ t spoken loud enough denise clark whose son has that peanut allergy is a consultant with boston medtech advisors she helps medical device companies with design market analysis and regulatory strategy but though she works in the field every day she says she never even thought much about the flaws of the epipen design — or the lack of innovation — until the product started hitting headlines it ’ s something that ’ s always been irritating to me but not to the point that i ’ ve looked at it closely — until i had to start paying all this money clark said granted the federal trade commission has been fielding complaints about mylan ’ s pricing for years and complaints about the device ’ s clunkiness are no secret but since the epipen is generally covered by insurance many customers have simply gone with it that means there ’ s been little pressure from the paying public for innovation i guess mylan ’ s motto is ‘ if it ain ’ t broke don ’ t fix it ’ clark said they have such a monopoly so why would they bother improving the epipen',\n",

came to think of as plan be existing only in the present as for the future allow me to introduce you to the gentleman of this article jason brian rosenthal he is an easy man to fall in love with i did it in one day let me explain my father ’ s best friend since summer camp uncle john had known jason and me separately our whole lives but jason and i had never met i went to college out east and took my first job in california when i moved back home to chicago john — who thought jason and i were perfect for each other — set us up on a blind date it was 1989 we were only 24 i had precisely zero expectations about this going anywhere but when he knocked on the door of my little frame house i thought uhoh there is something highly likable about this person by the end of dinner i knew i wanted to marry him jason he knew a year later i have never been on tinder bumble or eharmony but i ’ m going to create a general profile for jason right here based on my experience of coexisting in the same house with him for like 9490 days first the basics he is 5foot10 160 pounds with saltandpepper hair and hazel eyes the following list of attributes is in no particular order because everything feels important to me in some way he is a sharp dresser our young adult sons justin and miles often borrow his clothes those who know him — or just happen to glance down at the gap between his dress slacks and dress shoes — know that he has a flair for fabulous socks he is fit and enjoys keeping in shape if our home could speak it would add that jason is uncannily handy on the subject of food — man can he cook after a long day there is no sweeter joy than seeing him walk in the door plop a grocery bag down on the counter and woo me with olives and some yummy cheese he has procured before he gets to work on the evening ’ s meal jason loves listening to live music it ’ s our favorite thing to do together i should also add that our 19yearold daughter paris would rather go to a concert with him than anyone else when i was working on my first memoir i kept circling sections my editor wanted me to expand upon she would say i ’ d like to see more of this character get lifestyle news from the style travel and food sections from the latest trends to news you can use of course i would agree — he was indeed a captivating character but it was funny because she could have just said jason let ’ s add more about jason he is an absolutely wonderful father ask anyone see that guy on the corner go ahead and ask him he ’ ll tell you jason is compassionate — and he can flip a pancake jason paints i love his artwork i would call him an artist except for the law degree that keeps him at his downtown office most days from 9 to 5 or at least it did before i got sick if you ’ re looking for a dreamy let ’ sgoforit travel companion jason is your man he also has an affinity for tiny things taster spoons little jars a minisculpture of a couple sitting on a bench which he presented to me as a reminder of how our family began here is the kind of man jason is he showed up at our first pregnancy ultrasound with flowers this is a man who because he is always up early surprises me every sunday morning by making some kind of oddball smiley face out of items near the coffeepot a spoon a mug a banana this is a man who emerges from the minimart or gas station and says give me your palm and voilà a colorful gumball appears he knows i love all the flavors but white my guess is you know enough about him now so let ’ s swipe right wait did i mention that he is incredibly handsome i ’ m going to miss looking at that face of his if he sounds like a prince and our relationship seems like a fairy tale it ’ s not too far off except for all of the regular stuff that comes from two and a half decades of playing house together and the part about me getting cancer blech in my most recent memoir written entirely before my diagnosis i invited readers to send in suggestions for matching tattoos the idea being that author and reader would be bonded by ink i was totally serious about this and encouraged submitters to be serious as well hundreds poured in a few weeks after publication in august i heard from a 62yearold librarian in milwaukee named paulette she suggested the word more this was based on an essay in the book where i mention that more was my first spoken word true and now it may very well be my last time shall tell in september paulette drove down to meet me at a chicago tattoo parlor she got hers her very first on her left wrist i got mine on the underside of my left forearm in my daughter ’ s handwriting this was my second tattoo the first is a small lowercase j that has been on my ankle for 25 years you can probably guess what it stands for jason has one too but with more letters akr i want more time with jason i want more time with my children i want more time sipping martinis at the green mill jazz club on thursday nights but that is not going to happen i probably have only a few days left being a person on this planet so why i am doing this i am wrapping this up on valentine ’ s day and the most genuine nonvaseoriented gift i can hope for is that the

woman was murdered in front of their home but the three daughters of puerto rican parents were kept safe spending most of their time in school or at the boxing gym where their father refereed they learned how to block a punch and throw a right hook they bickered over clothes and went to dance class and dressed up for quinceañeras and one by one they proved their father right they could and

in the country and gina rodriguez won a best actress golden globe for her starring role on jane the virgin we lived the idea of the american dream gina says and they made an environment where that was possible the rodriguez family left and right courtesy of the rodriguez family this is a story about nine american families with children like the rodriguez kids who all went on to extraordinary success in different fields the emanuel brothers conquered medicine politics and hollywood the wojcicki sisters became scientists ceos and tech entrepreneurs the simmons brothers are a painter a rapper and a media mogul the antonoffs are now a rock star and a fashion designer the srinivasans include a judge a publichealth official and an entrepreneur and the gay siblings write books and run companies and design bridges the dungey sisters grew into an actor and a television executive one lin sibling designed the vietnam veterans memorial the other has written 12 books each of these families is different in thousands of ways from their ethnicities to their incomes to their sleepover policies but we set out to find the ways they are the same in selecting candidates to study we ignored siblings who do the same work in the same industry like venus and serena williams and families that come from a great fortune or legacy like the trumps or the kennedys we looked for families in which all the siblings did well and we defined success by leadership service or achievement not just fame or money alone of course genetics plays a role for every family but we focused on upbringing and sibling dynamics instead some of the consistencies are fairly predictable while none of these siblings grew up rich they were privileged in many other ways they had involved parents and lots of opportunities and most saw college as achievable even inevitable they weren ’ t abused or neglected and none grew up in abject want they didn ’ t have an unfair head start but they were spared some of the most difficult obstacles faced by less fortunate kids but other commonalities are more specific and more telling of the nine families eight had a parent who was an immigrant or an educator and five had a parent who was both many parents were involved in political activism of some kind most recall a conflictheavy family life but that conflict was rarely between the parents many had a strong awareness of mortality as children and most said they grew up with much more freedom than their friends did we talked to mayors and poets and judges and rappers jews from chicago and indians from kansas and haitians from nebraska we talked to siblings together and alone and we talked to parents where we could here are six striking qualities they shared immigrant drive as gino rodriguez was boxing with his daughters in chicago saroja srinivasan a hindu who is vegetarian was mastering the art of the hamburger she and her husband tp srinivasan settled in lawrence kans with their three small children in the early 1970s when tp joined the math department at the university of kansas everyone they knew was back in india we made a conscious decision that we are different enough so we should do everything we can to make the kids feel part of their community saroja recalls that meant cooking hot dogs and pizza as well as dosas and pakoras watching the kansas jayhawks in a living room adorned with indian devotional art and arranging presents under the family shrine to celebrate krishmas their version of christmas just like their neighbors the three srinivasan children—sri srija and \\xadsrinija—played basketball and went shopping and rode dirt bikes but they didn ’ t have chores in the same way their friends did in the srinivasan household less was required—but more was expected there was no one person responsible for the trash or dishes it was more like ‘ look around what ’ s mom doing does she need help ’ recalls srinija the youngest put things away pay attention also nobody got an allowance instead a drawer in the livingroom table contained petty cash for anyone to use on the one hand it meant great permissiveness that is way better than an allowance says srinija on the other hand responsibility for every choice her older sister srija put it this way if i took 20 that meant sri and srinija couldn ’ t go to the movies the srinivasan family left and right courtesy of the srinivasan family the three kids now adults say they grew up understanding that the family was more important than the individual a realization made especially poignant by the fact that their parents had left their own families behind to immigrate to the us for the srinivasans that sacrifice paid off sri would grow up to sit on the us court of appeals for the dc circuit his name was floated earlier this year as a candidate for the supreme court srija is the interim deputy chief for the san mateo county health system responsible for publichealth efforts

left courtesy of the wojcicki family right cody pickens for time esther had begun her daughters ’ ed\\xaducation long before they were peppering stanford physicists with questions about nuclear particles after working as a teacher and playground supervisor in the 1960s she began to suspect that earlychildhood education was more crucial than anyone then thought my theory was that the most important years were 0 to 5 she says it was a gut feeling so i made everything into a game she did arts and crafts projects with her toddler daughters took them to the library every week and taught them how to read count and swim before they even set foot in a classroom of course developmental experts have now proved esther right the first few years of a child ’ s life are among the most important for learning and brain development and between stan ’ s academic universe and esther ’ s educational parenting another commonality emerges seven of the nine families had a parent who was a teacher not all taught at the university level though three families had at least one professor as a parent the nine families also included parents who were elementaryschool teachers a preschool painting instructor a doctor who taught medical students a former french teacher and a school administrator who taught a night course on black history it may be that the job itself was less important

parent who was an educator created an unspoken expectation of academic achievement that was almost as powerful as familial love you probably have somewhere in the back of your mind that you don ’ t want to disappoint your teachers in the same way you don ’ t want to disappoint your parents says sri there was just no other way to think political activism on most nights the three emanuel boys would adjourn their ritual fistfight and flop on their mother ’ s bed to hear a story but sometimes she didn ’ t come home marsha emanuel was occasionally arrested as she demonstrated against segregation in 1960s chicago on those nights the boys bickered over the top bunk while marsha waited behind bars the emanuels would go on to become the stuff of legend and are often called the jewish

pediatrician father ’ s campaign against lead paint and their grandfather ’ s union loyalties the three rowdy youngsters couldn ’ t escape political awareness even if they tried if we did not go with her to a particular protest that protest was brought home rahm recalls sitting in the briefing room of the chicago mayor ’ s office just eating dinner was a test of current events the brothers also have a much younger adopted sister shoshana video by diane tsai for time that political engagement created a sense that the world was malleable and that the boys through their actions could be the ones to shape it you could by protesting or coming up with ideas actually change the world i think that ’ s a very important message says zeke it ’ s not that it will change necessarily but the world can change and that you have a responsibility to try to make a change political activism was a common theme for the parents in these families many of them were outspoken in their demands for reform in cities schools and housing complexes and never just for the benefit of their own children while none of the parents held high political office their involvement ranged from demonstrating for civil rights to union organizing to demanding that cities build new parks or that universities treat lowwage workers fairly when they weren ’ t pushing for reform they were mediating heated political debates at home the emanuel family left courtesy of the emanuel family right brooke collins—city of chicago daniel simmons sr also found himself arrested during civil rights demonstrations he worked as a new york city schoolattendance superintendent by day and taught a college course on black history by night his young sons remember waving goodbye as he boarded a bus from queens to see martin luther king jr at the march on washington in 1963 they stood with him on picket lines and visited his class on radical politics and they were watching when he lay down in front of a bulldozer to protest a segregated construction site now adults they say their father ’ s activism showed them how to get involved in the world outside themselves he had his own moral compass he knew what was right and what was fair and he demanded that kind of justice says russell simmons of his father it stuck with me it stuck by all my brothers as well it ’ s part of our makeup controlled chaos another thing

other guys occasionally they ’ d bring the fighting home one time danny took a comb and ran it through my hair and it hurt real bad says the youngest brother joseph known as rev run i think he was high their father didn ’ t try to shield his sons from all violence he respected what you learned in the culture in the street says russell so he never really hid us from the stuff that was right on

the less they do for themselves and the less empowered they feel she says thousands of extraordinary families flourish across america and the new generation of hyperaware parents may raise thousands more but none of the parents in this story set out to raise successful children instead the six commonalities of our nine families combined to create drive grit and social consciousness that propelled all the siblings on their own chosen paths you can not reach anybody ’ s goal you ’ ve got to reach your own goal says gino rodriguez you can not reach a goal unless you set that goal for yourself

died whats happened to me a star high school athlete who went on to play division i football for missouri state university andrew was an honors student whom friends described as outgoing charismatic and loyal he was also a heroin addict never even a recreational drug user andrew had been the first to discourage friends at his catholic high school from smoking pot but his story is frighteningly typical of the current heroin epidemic among suburban american youth its an issue made all the more timely by the recent heroinrelated death of glee star cory monteith best known and beloved for playing squeakyclean high school football star finn hudson what cory and andrew expose is that heroin isnt at all what it used to be not only is the drug much more powerful than before purity can be as high as 90 percent but its also no longer limited to the dirtyneedle backalley experience so many of us picture now its as easy as purchasing a pill because thats what heroin has become a powderfilled capsule known as a button designed to be broken open and snorted that can be purchased for just 10 and it regularly is—on varsity sports teams on ivy league campuses and in safe suburban neighborhoods during his sophomore year of college andrew fell ill from a virus that left him with pancreas damage soon after that he broke his hand add in routine wisdom teeth surgery and andrew was swimming in prescription painkillers he became addicted he would steal them he would buy them he would find them wherever he could remembers his friend 26yearold missouri native katie gerstenkorn he stole painkillers from me actually when andrew was given a capsule of heroin at a party he was instantly hooked according to dan duncan associate executive director at st louiss national council on alcoholism and drug abuse ncada most heroin users start with pain pills as andrew did its no wonder in an interview with 60 minutes last year national institute on drug abuse director dr nora volkow dropped the eyeopening statistic that in a country of 312 million people 210 million prescriptions for opiate medications were written in 2011 alone but pain pills are expensive—legally and on the black market—pushing those dependent on them to seek out a cheaper more easily accessible alternative with a similar kind of high heroin andrew went to his parents for help he couldnt get away from the drug says his mom pam its a hunger its a thirst you throw all your morals out the window before long he was caught stealing money from his roommates so he could buy more after a stint in rehab an overdose and another stint in rehab it looked like he was finally starting to get a handle on his addiction like cory monteith andrew was doing his best to clean up—and everyone in his life believed he could do it until the overdose that killed him in 2008 duncan and his ncada staff started getting an influx of calls about heroin to their help line it wasnt just that we were getting calls about heroin—we were getting calls about heroin and teens specifically he says it became clear that this was a problem in some of the best high schools in the area public private most of them by 2010 the year andrew died the number of calls about heroin had exploded the thing that was most startling was the average age of the deaths from heroin overdoses says st louis county police chief tim fitch historically the age for most heroin deaths has been in the 40to45 range but now the average age is between eighteen and 25 for some heroin abuse starts even earlier at fourteen emily was a high school freshman who had just made the varsity cheerleading squad by fifteen she was a regular heroin user despite her habit emily was able to maintain a facade at school getting good grades and staying out of trouble it was like i was leading a double life she says i thought maybe this is my little secret and its not as bad as everyone says it is at first she did it only on weekends with a friend of a friends older brother he would provide the drug for free but quickly began pressuring her to have sex with him eventually she caved i slept with him because i felt like he was giving something to me so i had to give something to him she admits looking back on it my selfesteem was so low and thats why i was doing all these things her supplier was 30 years old emily started skipping school and then didnt try out for cheerleading the next year doing heroin became part of her daily routine when a friend wanted to try it for her sixteenth birthday emily realized heroin wasnt her little secret anymore—it was something other kids at her school were doing too over the course of two years she entered treatment six times overdosed on heroin twice and ran away from home emily was thrown out of a hotel and a homeless shelter after that she returned home and attended twelvestep meetings but continued to use finally a switch flipped i was willing to go to any length to get high and then it became clear that i needed to go to any length to get sober i had to change every single thing in my life which was terrifying emily says but when the pain of staying the same was greater than the pain of change thats when i knew i really had to do something in 2012 and 2013 local news reports in denver chicago atlanta seattle orange county syracuse and a growing number of other areas told the tales of teens dying from heroin cases like andrews are becoming more of the norm while those of recovering addicts like emily seem to be more of the exception and with a year and a half of sobriety under her belt emily wants to expose teens to the scary prevalence of the drug that nearly killed her she speaks at schools and treatment centers and is studying to become a nurse today i can be a part of things instead of apart from them its so hard to describe the pain and the misery i felt the downward spiral emily says my worst day in sobriety is so much better than even my best day

despite the abundance of healing dr jenkins gives back to the world she went through great loss to get where she is today my oldest daughter kiona was diagnosed with two different types of brain tumors in 2002 when she was eight years old and i questioned whether chemotherapy and radiation was the right course of action for treatment for her explains dr jenkins i was informed that the state of california knows what ’ s better for my daughter than i do and that if i did anything different than conventional treatment then i ’ d be acting outside of medical advice and that i would be a threat to her unfortunately i was forced to accept but while she was going through chemotherapy and radiation i started researching and studying for my doctorate and figuring out other holistic alternatives kiona passed away in january 2006 12 days shy of her twelfth birthday dr jenkins now practices in her honor going back to her roots and using ancestral healing techniques my family is from the mississippi band of choctaw indians so we have native american lineage and my grandfather is a native healer she explains i just went back to my native roots and just researched along with her work as a healer dr jenkins strives to create room for minorities in the cannabis industry that is too often dominated by white men due to financial advantages and their inherent privilege there ’ s a privilege that is associated with being a white male in this country you don ’ t have that same type of fear that other minority groups or other people do and you ’ re more in a position to take a risk in jumping into this industry explains dr jenkins who has also been a part of the minority business council for three years her advice to women and other minorities looking to break through be fearless and strong in your conviction know what you stand for and know what you are trying to accomplish and don ’ t let anything get in your way surround yourself with other likeminded people who can be your support system and your tribe and then educate yourself because education is going to be what ’ s going to help you persevere because people are going to challenge you all the time but if you can come back with those challenges with hard evidence and experience and really speak to the level of professionalism that this industry is going to command you ’ ll be taken seriously 2 rachel k gillette attorney an unfortunate aspect of the cannabis industry is that due to lingering federal laws and constantly evolving local ones if you work with weed youll likely need a lawyer at some point that ’ s where rachel gillette comes in an attorney who has been working with the regulated cannabis industry since 2010 her areas of practice include corporate licensing compliance tax law for marijuana businesses and pretty much anything related to the operations of cannabis businesses regulated by the state of colorado i ’ ve always been an advocate for the legalization of marijuana says gillette so in 2010 when i saw the state of colorado was going to be regulating being the first state in the nation to do so i decided to quit my job and to start my own practice which focused on the representation of these newlyformed business enterprises at the time gillette was taking a major risk since few larger firms were ready to take on cannabis clients however gillette ’ s instincts and boldness paid off and she staked her claim in what is now a booming industry gillette says her favorite part the job is that marijuana law is constantly evolving we ’ re doing something that has never been done before so there ’ s a lot of opportunities to blaze the trail so to speak no pun intended she explains not to mention working to help victims of america ’ s war on drugs we ’ ve had 40 years of a failed drug war our fathers our brothers our children are incarcerated at alarming rates unfortunately for minority populations and disproportional rates for minority populations and as women we shouldn ’ t stand for that anymore 3 lynne lyman california state director for the drug policy alliance while california cannabis users celebrate their state ’ s recent marijuana legalization accomplishment nice hollyweed sign lynne lyman ’ s work is just getting started shes the california state director of the nonprofit organization drug policy alliance the leading organization advancing drug policies grounded in science compassion health and human rights we always say november 8th wasn ’ t the end it was the beginning she explains that ’ s true with most laws often policymakers forget to think about the implementation piece and sometimes that ’ s the most important piece because if you pass a law and it doesn ’ t get implemented then it ’ s as if it didn ’ t pass along with working to fund cannabis research lyman ’ s biggest passion is making marijuana and marijuanaadvocacy communities more inclusive especially by creating space for those were were a vital part of the weed industry before it was sanctioned by mainstream society you ’ re walking in today to this whole nice legal world where everybody can wear a name tag that says they ’ re with some cannabis association whereas five years ago even people were still doing federal time for having a dispensary lyman explains the advice i give to all of the people who come into the cannabis industry is understand the history there ’ s the sense that people are just waltzing in as if it ’ s just any other industry i want to discourage that and remind that a lot of people have died people have been incarcerated they ’ ve had their families destroyed making sure you ’ re a good neighbor and you ’ re working with the community that you are based in lyman says that while we see often see white men as the faces of legal weed businesses that doesnt mean theyre the ones who laid the groundwork for legalization in the first place one thing that has been true historically in the cannabis movement is that it ’ s been men ’ s faces at the forefront and yet it ’ s been a lot of women doing the behindthescenes work explains lyman i ’ m in room after room saying it can not be all white men in the industry you have to find a way to expand and let other people in that ’ s a policy priority for dpa 4 charlo greene founder of alaska cannabis club you may remember charlo greene from when she went viral for quitting her job as a reporter on like television while outing herself as the founder of alaska cannabis club now living in los angeles greene says i ’ m charlo fuck it i quit greene and i ’ m credited with the legalization of marijuana in alaska an exceptional entrepreneur she ’ s also behind newcannabistimescom and the founder of go greene a cannabis diversity summit series i use my connections to pull in as many community leaders of color to come in and share their knowledge experience and expertise with people that really need a leg up in this industry and make it mean something for them and their communities says greene i think a lot of the work that i ’ m doing is overlooked because i am a woman and because i am a person of color greene ’ s success has come with a heavy price that proves the war on drugs in far from over i ’ m facing 54 years for creating the alaska cannabis club so in the meantime it ’ s dreary that my life could be over this year she explains but if i stop doing what i know i am here to do which is share these amazing stories and activate people then the state has already won greene adds that she didn ’ t quit her job as a reporter because she hated it but because she knew there was work to be done in marijuana advocacy there was a community of people that needed someone to be bold and i knew that was me so i ’ m gon na continue what i ’ m doing just on my own terms with the weed show her next court appearance is january 11 and she ’ s assembled a topnotch legal team and is feeling hopeful yet knows both america and the weed industry still have insurmountable work to do it will be interesting when they try to drag up club members that literally credit the alaska cannabis club for saving their lives i think the state of alaska will be on trial just as much as they ’ re putting me on trial 5 jessica peters president of moxie meds moxie meds a cbdrich line of cannabis tinctures is medicine for women by women available

advised this years questioners to be as invisible as possible but scrutiny is inevitable before the lights go on here are five things to know about holt holt is a registered republican donald trump has spent the weeks leading up to the general election debates predicting unfair treatment by the moderators he says the media using criticism of matt lauers performance during a candidates forum this month to pressure the moderators into attack mode theyre hitting matt lauer and thats sort of indicative of what theyre — theyre trying to game the system trump told fox news last weekend they want — and this i think is terrible — they want the hosts to go after trump and thats what theyre doing by gaming the system conspiratorial as trumps theory is it cant be disproven but the shot he took at holt can be lester is a democrat trump told bill oreilly last week it ’ s a phony system they are all democrats it ’ s a very unfair system these are the people who will be lobbing questions at republican donald trump and democrat hillary clinton when they go headtohead at the 2016 presidential debates the first debate is slated for september 26 sarah parnassthe washington post time magazine checked the voter rolls in new york and it turns out holt is actually a registered republican trump still might find things to complain about monday night but a case for partisan bias against him will be tough to make holt is the first black presidential debate moderator since 1992 holt whose grandparents immigrated to the united stats from jamaica is the first black moderator of a general election presidential debate since carole simpson in 1992 gwen ifill moderated vicepresidential debates in 2004 and 2008 and bernard shaw moderated the vp debate in 2000 but it has been 24 years since a black journalist moderated a debate between the majorparty nominees for president holt whom nbc declined to make available for interviews before the debate does not talk about his race often he did say this to the chicago tribune in 1995 when the paper profiled the thenanchor of wbbmtvs nightly newscast everyone knows im black i am who i am this is the person that lester sr and june holt raised and i make no apology for it at the same time im never going to pull a race card to get what i want you cant have it both ways dominic carter a fellow black tv journalist who moderated one of hillary clintons senate campaign debates in 2006 said holts selection is significant but viewers should not expect his background to influence his questioning we are journalists first carter said thats a huge distinction were not there to advocate on issues relating to african americans were there advocating and asking questions on behalf of the american people you dont want people to put you in the box of the black guy doing the debate so you have to be over and above in terms of fairness and professionalism hes not really into the twitter holt 57 has not tweeted in almost a month he was fairly active

democratic primary debate holt got to practice his moderating skills at a democratic debate in january though he split questioning duties that night with andrea mitchell he was not involved in any major clashes during the debate but showed a willingness to ask tough questions such as when he asked clinton about the reset button with russia during her tenure as secretary of state secretary clinton you famously handed russias foreign minister a reset button in 2009 holt said since then russia has annexed crimea fomented a war in ukraine provided weapons that downed an airliner and launched operations as we just did discuss to support assad in syria as president would you hand vladimir putin a reset button holt has two honorary doctorates but no bachelors degree apparently the secret to becoming a bigtime political anchor is not graduating from college meet the press anchor chuck todd never finished his studies at george washington university he told me he plans to do so

that have been trying to combat the problem in their work forces publish everyone ’ s pay when employers publish people ’ s salaries the pay gap shrinks jake rosenfeld a sociologist at washington university has found that salary transparency raises wages in part by lending legitimacy to employees ’ arguments in wage bargaining even being cognizant of gender pay disparity being an issue can change norms he said that has been true in the public sector where disclosing pay information is often required alexandre mas an economist at princeton studied the effects of a 2010 california law that required cities to publish municipal salaries it prompted pay cuts but only among men women might have been spurred to negotiate after seeing that their salaries were lower he theorized or cities might have made salaries more equitable to avoid lawsuits a few european countries have required that big companies publish pay information by sex president obama in 2014 required that federal contractors report it to the labor department other american companies say they have analyzed pay this way though most do it privately marc benioff the ceo of salesforcecom said last year that after such an analysis the company spent 3 million to make women ’ s salaries equal to men ’ s kimberlyclark and pricewaterhousecoopers have said their examinations led managers to address the fact that fewer women were reaching top positions to negotiate or not men are paid more partly because they ’ re much more likely to ask for it when receiving job offers 515 percent of men and 125 percent of women asked for more money according to a study of carnegie mellon university graduate students by linda babcock an economist at the university in other research she found that when women did ask they asked for 30 percent less than men requested because starting salaries determine raises and future salaries women who do not bargain lose as much as 750000 for middleincome jobs and 2 million for highincome jobs over their careers ms babcock found but her research and that of others has found that women are penalized for negotiating while men are rewarded for the same behavior as the actress jennifer lawrence wrote in lenny after the sony hacking revealed that she was paid less than her male costars she didn ’ t fight for more because i didn ’ t want to seem ‘ difficult ’ or ‘ spoiled ’ one solution ms babcock said is to coach women to negotiate another is to change corporate practices so the people who set compensation are aware of the disparity and are advocates for women during negotiations another answer is to ban pay negotiation completely that is what ellen pao did when she was chief executive of reddit the company established pay ranges based on roles and experience and gave applicants nonnegotiable offers we put the onus on the company to pay fairly instead of on candidates to negotiate fair pay ms pao wrote in the hollywood reporter don ’ t rely on previous salaries if women can lose millions over their careers because they get job offers based on pay that is already low one way to stop the pattern is to ignore their past salaries google has said it does this and instead makes offers based on what a job is worth in august the federal office of personnel management said government hiring managers could no longer rely on an employee ’ s previous salary when setting his or her new one the acting director beth cobert explained that the practice particularly disadvantaged women who had taken time off to raise children women are also more likely to have worked in the lowerpaying public or nonprofit sectors don ’ t ask about salary history for new hires and it really reduces the impact of previous discrimination ms babcock said i think that is the most effective thing organizations can do make work easier for mothers research has found that salaries at men and women ’ s first jobs out of school are fairly similar the gender pay gap widens a few years later when women start having children sometimes their pay lags because they take breaks from work when their children are young work fewer hours or take more time off than men for child care crises sometimes their employers assume they ’ ll do so even if they don ’ t policies that help keep women in the work force like affordable child care paid sick days and parental leave could help in states that offer paid parental leave for instance mothers are more likely to return to work work more hours and earn higher wages economists have found if a cashier gets pregnant has no parental leave has to leave and reapply for her job that ’ s not the same as making a career choice said philip cohen a sociologist at the university of maryland one thing policy can do is make it easier for women to stick with their careers build more flexible workplaces ms goldin of harvard has found that the pay gap is largest in occupations with the least flexibility in terms of where and when people work like finance and medicine the gap shrinks when people can work on their own schedules as in many tech jobs and when people can easily substitute for one another as happens among pharmacists then women aren ’ t penalized as much for working fewer hours companies might address the culture of face time and overwork and change how they operate in a pharmacy for instance electronic medical records have made it easier for different pharmacists to serve the same patient change the law federal law doesn ’ t require most of these things so some lawmakers are trying other tactics the strongest equal pay bill in the country went into effect in california this month it says that men and women must be paid the same for similar jobs not just for exactly the same job at the same site as the looser federal equal pay act requires the california law also prohibits employers from retaliating against workers for discussing pay proposed federal legislation known as the paycheck fairness act would require companies to report pay data to the government give grants for negotiation training and make classaction lawsuits easier but that legislation is stalled in congress',\n",

wonder how someone managed to deceive you now body language expert judi james has revealed the key signs to look out for if youre concerned someone is being economical with the truth while she warns that there is no set formula for spotting a liar recognising some of the signs can help you root out a fibber forget all those claims of tells and other body language giveaways that reveal when someone is being economical with the truth a bad liar might blush and sweat and show physical signs of agitation like fidgeting she explained but a practised liar can easily deliver a lie while looking cool calm and confident despite the fact there are no onesizefitsall symptoms to spot the following tips should help alert you to the fact that someone ’ s not being totally honest with you the big pause lying is quite a complex process for the body and brain to deal with first your brain produces the truth which it then has to suppress before inventing the lie and the performance of that lie this often leads to a longer pause than normal before answering plus a verbal stalling technique like ‘ why do you ask that ’ rather than a direct and open response the eye dart humans have more eye expressions than any other animal and our eyes can give away if we ’ re trying to hide something when we look up to our left to think we ’ re often accessing recalled memory but when our eyes roll up to our right we can be thinking more creatively also the guilt of a lie often makes people use an eye contact cutoff gesture such as looking down or away the lost breath bending the truth causes an instant stress response in most people meaning the fight or flight mechanisms are activated the mouth dries the body sweats more the pulse rate quickens and the rhythm of the breathing changes to shorter shallower breaths that can often be both seen and heard overcompensating a liar will often overperform both speaking and gesticulating too much in a bid to be more convincing these over the top body language rituals can involve too much eye contact often without blinking and overemphatic gesticulation the poker face although some people prefer to employ the poker face many assume less is more and almost shut down in terms of movement and eye contact when they ’ re being economical with the truth the face hide when someone tells a lie they often suffer a strong desire to hide their face from their audience this can lead to a partial cutoff gesture like the wellknow nose touch or mouthcover selfcomfort touches the stress and discomfort of lying often produces gestures that are aimed at comforting the liar such as rocking hairstroking or twiddling or playing with wedding rings we all tend to use selfcomfort gestures but this will increase dramatically when someone is fibbing microgestures these are very small gestures or facial expressions that can flash across the face so quickly they are difficult to see experts will often use filmed footage that is then slowed down to pick up on the true body language response emerging in the middle of the performed lie the best time to spot these in real life is to look for the facial expression that occurs after the liar has finished speaking the mouth might skew or the eyes roll in an instant giveaway heckling hands the hardest body parts to act with are the hands or feet and liars often struggle to keep them onmessage while they lie when the gestures and the words are at odds it ’ s called incongruent gesticulation and it ’ s often the hands or feet that are telling the truth judi james is supporting macmillan cancer support ’ s new murder mystery fundraising game whodunnit and says learning how to lie might help if you decide to take part while i don ’ t usually condone lying this is the perfect opportunity to try your hand at being economical with the truth she said convince yourself first the brain likes to see the whole manufactured story which it can then perform using body language don ’ t just think of the transcript visualise the whole story including all the smallest details visualisation is the nearest you ’ ll get to making the lie reality and that helps make your body language signals congruent relax to combat the fightflight response breathe out slowly and deliberately to relax your muscles especially the ones in your shoulders arms and hands keep your vocal tone a little lower lying can make us more shrill slow your blink rate fibbing often causes a giveaway accelerated blink rate slow your own down a little as this will help create reassurance in your audience keep busy if you ’ re not very good at lying try to keep busy when you perform the lie actors call this a ‘ bit of business ’ which is when less competent actors continue washing up or potting plants while being quizzed rather than struggling with their body language sip a cup of tea etc it might look rude but it can be better than oversharing in terms of your body language giveaways tell the truth first in an emergency such as ‘ do you like my new hair cut ’ or ‘ am i the best lover you ’ ve ever had ’ it can help if you expel the truth first for example ‘ it looks terrible ’ or ‘ no you ’ re

              " 'Summarize:condition: how trump could win paragraph: joe raedlegetty images at this moment polls show a strong upswing for donald trump ’ s campaign he ’ s made real ground on hillary clinton closing the gap between them by consolidating the republican party behind his candidacy clinton meanwhile is fighting a contentious primary which keeps her from doing the same there ’ s still a strong case to make that donald trump is a long shot for the white house—that he ’ s too unpopular with too many americans outside the republican party and that if the obama coalition holds he loses jamelle bouie jamelle bouie is slate ’ s chief political correspondent at least that ’ s what i think but humility is a virtue and life is volatile even if elections often aren ’ t that trump is a poor bet for november doesn ’ t mean he couldn ’ t win he could which raises an obvious question how would it happen and finding an answer here isn ’ t too difficult you just need to reverseengineer the conditions of a trump loss what are those conditions at the top of the list is demographics trump is deeply unpopular with black and latino voters as well as with women and young people but clinton is also unpopular albeit by a smaller magnitude given two unpopular candidates it ’ s possible that popularity just won ’ t matter as much that voters will take both candidates ’ worst qualities as a given and move on in which case both clinton and trump become generic nominees and what are the prospects this year for a generic republican nominee of five separate econometric models of the election four predict a republican win ranging from 509 percent of the vote to 55 percent of the twoparty vote the economy is middling president obama wellliked but not hugely popular and clinton would be a third term for democrats given two generic candidates under those criteria the presidency would go to the republican say hello to president trump let ’ s say you don ’ t trust the models they couldn ’ t predict trump after all then what how would trump win assuming key parts of the electorate are aligned against him the answer is easy he wins and turns out white voters in historic numbers assume higher nonwhite support for the democrat—let ’ s say a threepoint bump among blacks and a sevenpoint bump among hispanics giving clinton 97 percent and 80 percent support respectively—and trump needs 66 percent of whites to win both the popular and electoralcollege vote if turnout doesn ’ t change you can play with the numbers over at realclearpolitics how would trump win assuming key parts of the electorate are aligned against him he turns out white voters in historic numbers it ’ s an extraordinary reach an increase of nearly six points over the white share in 2012 matching ronald reagan ’ s performance in 1984 it would mean trump persuaded millions of democrats to switch teams despite their wide approval for president obama in other words it ’ s not happening partisanship has a tight hold on american voting behavior and it ’ s hard to imagine how trump could break it barring a national catastrophe easier to imagine is higher white turnout if trump could reverse the yearslong decline and bring white turnout back to its 2008 levels—74 percent—then he could win with another couple percentage points among whites even with the high black and latino turnout of 2008 this would give him teetering democratic states such as new hampshire pennsylvania and wisconsin as well as the three largest swing states florida ohio and virginia it ’ s a heavy lift especially for a candidate who says he will eschew datagathering and other quantitative methods for finding and mobilizing supporters but it ’ s possible ok ok possible doesn ’ t mean likely and it ’ s hard to imagine a disorganized campaign exceeding team romney ’ s ability to pinpoint and bring republicanleaning white voters to the polls still with a smile from fortuna or whichever god of chance you prefer trump can win if anything guarantees defeat for an incumbent party it ’ s a recession at the opening of the 1960 election in early spring of that year john f kennedy and richard nixon were neck and neck this continued into the summer and the early fall but by october kennedy had opened a small but persistent lead he won it ’ s hard to isolate a single cause for kennedy ’ s victory but he was almost certainly helped along by the modest recession that struck in the spring and lasted until the following winter if not for that downturn there ’ s a fair chance nixon would have become president a sudden slowdown could have the same effect on our election in fact the very presence of trump—his proximity to the most powerful office in the world—could destabilize markets and make a downturn more likely and consider this on average the united states sees a recession every five years we ’ re due one is all we need for president trump a terrorist attack could do it—driving voters into the arms of the authoritarian in the race—but the literature is mixed on how terrorism affects voters it could make them more attuned to perceived outsiders—and immigrants in particular—giving trump an advantage it could push them toward hawkish candidates with traditional credentials helping clinton or given the candidates it could be a wash so let ’ s table this one there ’ s one last thing that could deliver the white house to trump a divided democratic party party unity is a prerequisite for national competition it ’ s why the never trump movement fell apart after ted cruz left the race a serious effort to derail the republican nominee would guarantee a democratic white house because it ’ s almost impossible to overcome the asymmetry in the still unlikely event that the present acrimony between bernie sanders and the democratic party becomes an outright split democrats risk throwing the election to trump through infighting and division if sanders runs as a thirdparty candidate the game is over and democrats lose you see this in the most recent polling clinton ’ s biggest weakness in the nbc news survey of registered voters is with sanders ’ backers who haven ’ t crossed the threshold to team clinton if this persists it ’ s dangerous if history is any indication however it won ’ t be with all this said even the most probable scenario here—that trump and clinton become generic candidates—is a distant long shot they ’ re just too wellknown for voters to treat them as interchangeable with any republican or any democrat and

would be this freaking hard either everywhere you look you see haphaphappy couples you see the smiling picture perfect family photos on facebook and think to yourself i bet they don ’ t fight about what kind of cereal to buy you see other parents and wonder if they were up until 2 am bickering about whose turn it was to get up with the baby you see cute couples at the park on the weekend pushing their toddlers in the swings and doubt they have ever gone through the lowgrade suckiness that you ’ re in right now well i can assure you that they have we all have sure our hard times all look different—because each marriage is different—but i assure you that we ’ ve all been through our own rocky stretches on the path to marital bliss because here ’ s the thing that no one tells you marriage is fucking hard it will suck sometimes and do you know what else they don ’ t tell you it ’ s ok that marriage is hard and sucky sometimes you will be ok your marriage will be ok here ’ s a few other things no one tells you about marriage the things that no one writes in your bridal shower scrapbook of clichédcrockofshit advice there will be fights you will fight about big things and little things and things you don ’ t even care about you will fight about whether to shop at walmart or costco about whether your son needs a haircut and whether your aunt josie is a racist or just an idiot you will argue late into the night about whether to sign your daughter up for dance lessons or the soccer team you will have dropdown dragout brawls about whether the toilet seat should be left up or down and you will give each other the silent treatment for two days after one of you suggests that your mother might be a little needy there will be anger in fact you might scare yourself with the depth of blind rage that you feel when you see his socks on the floor or hear her loud chewing you might want to smother him with a pillow when he snores blissfully as you get up in the middle of the night—again—to feed the baby get the toddler a drink of water or calm the big kid after a scary dream you might nearly lose your fucking mind when she runs out of gas—again—and you need to leave a work meeting early and drive 60 minutes roundtrip to pick her up there will be scorekeeping you will tally up who slept less and who worked longer hours you will keep track of who changed the last diaper and whose turn it is to control the remote you measure who spends more hours chauffeuring the kids to soccer practice and ballet lessons and who spends more hours working in a deadend job that pays the bills and puts food on the table you will keep score of the number of socks on the floor dirty dishes in the sink and toilet paper rolls unchanged and there will be hard times and not the romantic hypothetical hard times that you imagined before you had kids the kind that involve short fights followed by steamy makeup sex no marriage is really fucking hard sometimes but here ’ s something else no one might have told you it ’ s ok that marriage is hard because even with the fighting and the anger and the difficult times marriage is pretty fucking great the truth is some of the most amazing things in life—marriage and parenting among them—are really hard work marriage is not all heartshaped rainbows and diamonds made from unicorn poop marriage is not skipping in the park together before having porn star sex in the middle of the afternoon and marriage is not one of those cheesy status updates on facebook with words like soul mates and soblessed marriage is hard work and there will be difficult times now and then because when you share your freaking life with someone else—raising a family and building careers paying taxes and choosing netflix shows—it is impossible not to get bogged down in the muck now and then but you will get through it you will remember that you ’ re on the same team you will fight and then you will forgive you will compromise you will get therapy if you need to you will take a deep breath flip each other off and then laugh at yourselves so fear not you are not alone marriage is hard for everyone now and then and making it through those sucky stretches might even make your marriage better because even though marriage has its hard and shitty days marriage is also knowing you have someone on your side who will hold an

to for the last several years no not just cheering for the basketball team he owns the los angeles clippers it ’ s a novel project and he plans to take the wrapping off it tuesday but first the back story which is a valuable prelude to a description of the project itself when mr ballmer retired as chief executive of microsoft in 2014 he was only 57 and quickly realized i don ’ t quote ‘ have anything to do ’ as he looked for a new endeavor — before he decided to buy the clippers — his wife connie encouraged him to help with some of her philanthropic efforts an idea he initially rejected but come on doesn ’ t the government take care of the poor the sick the old mr ballmer recalled telling her after all he pointed out he happily paid a lot of taxes and he figured that all that tax money should create a sufficient social safety net her answer a it won ’ t because there are things government doesn ’ t get to and b you ’ re missing it mr ballmer replied no i ’ m not that conversation led mr ballmer to pursue what may be one of the most ambitious private projects undertaken to answer a question that has long vexed the public and politicians alike he sought to figure out what the government really does with the money mr ballmer said what really happens on tuesday mr ballmer plans to make public a database and a report that he and a small army of economists professors and other professionals have been assembling as part of a stealth startup over the last three years called usafacts the database is perhaps the first nonpartisan effort to create a fully integrated look at revenue and spending across federal state and local governments want to know how many police officers are employed in various parts of the country and compare that against crime rates want to know how much revenue is brought in from parking tickets and the cost to collect want to know what percentage of americans suffer from diagnosed depression and how much the government spends on it that ’ s in there you can slice the numbers in all sorts of ways mr ballmer calls it the equivalent of a 10k for government referring to the kind of annual filing that companies make you know when i really wanted to understand in depth what a company was doing amazon or apple i ’ d get their 10k and read it he told me in a recent interview in new york it ’ s wonky it ’ s this it ’ s that but it ’ s the greatest depth you ’ re going to get and it ’ s accurate in an age of fake news and questions about how politicians and others manipulate data to fit their biases mr ballmer ’ s project may serve as a powerful antidote using his website usafactsorg a person could look up just about anything how much revenue do airports take in and spend what percentage of overall tax revenue is paid by corporations at the very least it could settle a lot of bets made during public policy debates at the dinner table i would like citizens to be able to use this to form intelligent opinions mr ballmer said people can disagree about what to do — i ’ m not going to tell people what to do but he said people ought to base their opinions on common data sets that are believable so how exactly does one go about collecting and ordering the nation ’ s data before he started mr ballmer was convinced someone must have already done this his first instinct naturally was to go to a search engine my favorite one of course i go to bing he said and by the way i check it with google just to make sure there ’ s nothing i ’ m missing but neither option led him to what he was looking for you ’ ve got to look at federal state and local together mr ballmer said because i ’ m a citizen i don ’ t care whether i give my money to a b or c i just want to know how it lands how it impacts what ’ s going on with an unlimited budget he went about hiring a team of researchers in seattle and made a grant to the university of pennsylvania to help his staff put the information together altogether he has spent more than 10 million between direct funding and grants let ’ s say it costs three four five million a year he said i ’ m happy to fund the damn thing for mr ballmer the experience has been worth every cent simply for the surprises that he has discovered looking at the data i love this one he said showing me a slide of information about government employees don ’ t look don ’ t look he instructed me to cover my eyes from the number at the bottom of the page how many people work for government in the united states he asked with the excitement of a child showing off a new toy before displaying the answer almost 24 million would you have guessed that then people say ‘ those damn bureaucrats ’ mr ballmer exclaimed channeling the criticism that government is bloated and filled with waste fraud and abuse well let ’ s look at that people who work in schools higher ed public institutions of education — they are government employees and they represent almost half of the 24 million his data shows and you say ok what are the other big blocks mr ballmer continued well activeduty military war fighters government hospitals really i didn ’ t know that suddenly he explained the faceless bureaucrats who are often pilloried as symbols of government waste start to look like the people in our neighborhood whom we ’ re very glad to have now people might not think they ’ re government employees but your tax dollars are helping somehow to pay 24 million people — and most of these people you like mr ballmer said his other big surprises most of the notforprofits we work with would be 50 to 90 percent government funded mr ballmer said referring to various efforts to fight poverty that he has supported i mean it ’ s funny but i didn ’ t realize all these notforprofits were in a sense almost like government contractors mr ballmer said he wanted the project to be completely apolitical he has given money to candidates on both sides of the aisle but as he speaks you can tell that some of his findings from the new data — which rebut his preconceptions — could change his own politics at one point as he showed me the value of certain tax deductions and blurted out if you look at these tax deductions for employerprovided health or for state and local taxes or mortgageinterest deductions they ’ re really subsidies to the affluent which i guess i hadn ’ t thought about them take the mortgage deduction he continued this is to stimulate homeownership amongst people who are already going to own homes that is worth to a middleincome family a hundred bucks a year i was a little surprised by that you can have your own reaction i was a little surprised by that one rule mr ballmer said his team made early on was to use only government data — no outside providers — to avoid accusations of bias but this created its own challenges for example mr ballmer said you know it ’ s not legal to know how many firearms that are in this country the government is not allowed to collect the number there is data for the number of firearms manufactured licenses inspections along with other data but not a total he said i can ’ t show it i ’ m shocked but the nra apparently has lobbied in such a way government can ’ t report the data mr ballmer is hoping that the website is just the beginning he hopes to open it up so that individuals and companies can build on top of it and pull out customized reports we ’ re making philanthropic donations elsewhere — i think of this as another he said referring to himself and his wife i don ’ t even deduct this for my taxes i pay this with aftertax money no pretax money because i don ’ t want anybody being able to think that factors in but i feel like it ’ s a civic contribution more than anything else',\n",

but with hair nobody marries men with hands like that when he goes to a meetup he ’ s planned with a strange woman he shoves his hand down her throat enjoying that he can see how his intrusive hand bulges her neck he recalls taking a prostitute to a motel room i sat down next to her and splayed my hands out on the bed ‘ what do you think about these ’ i asked nobody ever gave me the answer i wanted nobody ever said ‘ oh so beautiful ’ moshfegh ’ s fiction is nothing if not distinctive as in her debut novel eileen the narrators of the 14 stories in homesick for another world are gloomy narcissistic and selfpitying their lives are claustrophobic and squalid they ’ re constantly squeezing their acne having sex with people they despise eating candy and drinking until they ’ re sick

contempt in one story a man obsesses over a woman who works at a video game arcade he frequents he finally manages to secretly court her via text but quickly loses his interest in her once she seems attainable he took out his phone and reread all her texts again ‘ i am very lonely and troubled who are you ’ she sounded desperate he thought he had made a grievous mistake he thought in a story called the beach boy a man ’ s wife dies suddenly after their 29th anniversary celebration on a tropical island initially devastated and adrift he then catches sight of an unfamiliar face in the photos he developed from the trip though it ’ s out of focus and contextfree he ’ s convinced that it was a picture taken by his late wife ― of a male prostitute from the island suddenly he ’ s revolted by her the woman he thought was a lady but who he ’ s now certain was unfaithful marcia was gone for good now moshfegh writes after her ashes were disposed of and he felt like celebrating the

pursuing his dream of acting she quietly loathes him the way he clenches his muscles constantly to stay in shape his devotion to a crystal skull he keeps by his bed the yellow women ’ s blazer he

small town subsisting on subs and drugs she has a brief fling with a local i still remember the humility it took for me to agree to take him home she hires a heavily pregnant young woman to clean her home then calmly ignores it when her housekeeper begins to hemorrhage on the job the unpleasant even grotesque behaviors of her characters seem amplified thanks to moshfegh ’ s cool matteroffact prose in either firstperson or close thirdperson narration the blunt unemotional words with which her characters relate their petty cruelties addictions and even bodily functions never ceases to be slightly jarring in much fiction writers draw us in by painting the relatable lovable vulnerabilities within even their most nominally unsympathetic characters complicating our impulse to divide the world into good and bad moshfegh ’ s stories do the reverse confronting readers with the squicky selfish and sociopathic inner selves of even outwardly decent people reading homesick for another world offers a similar experience to watching a dark comedy like the british sitcom peep show there ’ s something refreshing and funny about her unvarnished portrayal of human squalor but also something unsettling and difficult to swallow it ’ s not a book to reassure readers of the essential goodness of the human race it ’ s a queasy jolt to our optimistic selves a reminder of the lowest most iddriven proclivities of humanity this may sound unappealing yet moshfegh ’ s talent is a sheer delight ― and the heedless misbehavior of her characters is a reminder needed now more than ever that we ’ re not such an elevated species as we ’ d like to think and that following our base impulses can lead us nowhere fast the bottom line moshfegh ’ s stories of selfish people doing foul things capture the dark side of human nature which is easy but selfdeluding to ignore what other reviewers think the new york times if there ’ s a thematic thread weaving through this collection it ’ s the complicated relationship between entrapment in the physical body — her characters are often probing picking and searching with their fingertips as if seeking beauty and potential grace — and entrapment in social landscapes npr there ’ s not a story in homesick for another world that ’ s anything less than original and perfectly constructed moshfegh ’ s talent is unique and her characters — unfiltered cold

              " 'Summarize:condition: this is why the media can ’ t stop writing about mad men paragraph: one of the most consistent criticisms of mad men from those who arent mad men fans is that — sniffs derisively — its only beloved by the coastal media elite because its about rich white people who live glamorous lives and work in advertising that strain of criticism became all the more pronounced in the buildup to the amc dramas series finale with vulture launching the latest broadside against the shows popularity as author michael idov argued that it wasnt truly popular just overhyped to support his claim he points in part to the shows lack of an audience in russia to some degree this is true back when the series debuted the media wrote about mad men to a level far exceeding its actual ratings the first seasons viewership numbers dipped below the 1 million mark a few times — a much more perilous event in an age when dvrs and streaming services were less prevalent but by season two the awards and critical attention mad men garnered ended up boosting those numbers to more comfortable levels and even if the show was never a smash hit it had a long healthy run still there are a bunch of good mostly reductive reasons for the media to keep in idovs words shoving mad men down readers throats here are five 1 readers wanted to read about it in my prevox life i was the tv editor of the av club a position that gave me unique insight into what sorts of tv content readers wanted to consume and every time we wrote about mad men those numbers spiked the show was consistently among the top five series we wrote about in terms of readership and a welltimed thinkpiece always had the potential to blow up the mad men audience overlaps so neatly with the audience of people who read about tv on the internet that the venn diagram of the two might as well be a single circle this has carried right over to vox we write a lot about the show because theres a huge audience out there ready to devour mad men content — far beyond any other show ive written about here thats not game of thrones the mad men audience overlaps so neatly with the audience of people who read about tv on the internet that the venn diagram of the two might as well be a single circle yes the huge explosion of commentary in the days preceding the shows finale was driven by how much many of us in the media liked the show but it was also driven by the fact that our readers wanted to see this sort of material some of that was an accident of timing 2 mad men debuted right after the sopranos ended and filled the void the show left when mad men began in the summer of 2007 the sopranos had ended just a few weeks before the wire never as popular in terms of raw readership numbers though no slouch itself would end in early 2008 lost was the king of the recap roost at the time but those who wrote about it usually focused more on grand unified theories of why the show worked rather than the sorts of symbolic interpretations the sopranos invited mad men also benefitted from the rise of tv recapping in general thus there was a huge opening in the reading about tv on the internet marketplace that was beginning to boom in the late 2000s and mad men filled it as surely as it filled the slots vacated by sopranos at the golden globes and the emmys the two shows thematic concerns use of dreamlike imagery and storytelling structure were incredibly similar which only helped matters but mad men also benefited from the rise of tv recapping in general alan sepinwall began his seminal blog whats alan watching in late 2005 and by that final sopranos season dozens of publications were dipping their toes into the recap waters that number would explode in years to come — and mad men was a natural fit for publications that wanted to write tv recaps and people who wanted to read them 3 there just wasnt as much good tv on when mad men started it was popular to suggest that the end of the sopranos the cancellation of hbos deadwood and the impending end of the wire signaled the end of tvs golden age sound familiar instead mad men and later breaking bad picked up that ball and ran with it while fx entered the early stages of a hot streak that continues to this day but really in that summer of 2007 the established shows worth writing about were few and far between — especially if you didnt want to publish weekly indepth reviews of comedies a later development largely driven by contenthungry sites like well the av club they were essentially limited to the wire dexter lost heroes 24 greys anatomy and maybe veronica mars if your readership was especially young thus it was easy to get the serious tv audience to tune in to mad men because there werent a ton of other options mad men suggested every cable channel should have its own scripted drama series in development — and now they pretty much all do contrast that to today when a show like the americans cant get the same sort of readership traction as mad men even though it has a loyal dedicated audience that likes reading about it simply because theres so much more stuff out there this most recent season of that fx drama received the kind of acclaim mad men did in its heyday — but its much much harder for a series to cut through the noise from all those other shows out there mad men suggested every single cable channel should have its own scripted drama in development — and now they pretty much all do 4 mad men was actually pretty popular when all was said and done though it never pulled in big bang theory numbers amc told vultures joe adalian that at the shows height a total of just under 7 million people watched it that numbers not insignificant and even a tiny percentage of that audience consistently reading pieces about the show online would be more than enough to drive significant traffic to most websites — especially back in 2007 when the overall online readership was smaller 5 never underestimate passion as my colleague matthew yglesias wrote about the popularity of bernie sanders presidential candidacy online a small but rabidly passionate audience for a particular topic can be lifeblood to a website that craves readers what holds true for sanders is also true for mad men there are very few casual mad men fans and those passionate fans tend to seek out everything they can find about the show early on the media positioned mad men as a sort of lifestyle choice the media is of course at least somewhat complicit in this early on we positioned the series as a sort of lifestyle choice — if you were cool you would watch mad men but tv sites have said that about a lot of shows over the years and few of them held up readershipwise as well as mad men did whither boardwalk empire yes the early push might have been a bit much but mad men ended up having the goods — at least for the people who cared about it i agree with the theoretical concerns behind the criticisms of media coverage of mad men those of us who write about television do too often ignore the shows that a majority of americans are actually watching shows like the big bang theory and ncis and even empire but the kinds of people who read our websites are also far more likely to want to take a deep dive into the latest episode of mad men than they are to want to read a careful analysis of even several episodes of ncis believe me ive tried the answer to why the media keeps pushing mad men on the people is simple the people keep pushing it on us',\n",

manage high blood cholesterol confusion reigns we checked the most recent research from trials that tested the impact of specific foods on blood cholesterol the verdict good news first eating more nuts legumes plant sterols molecules found in plants and olive oil helps lower blood cholesterol the bad news discretionary foods aka junk raise blood cholesterol especially bad cholesterol called ldl eating less lowers it do you know your blood cholesterol level if you dont ask your gp to check it over a third of australian adults have high cholesterol 1 eat legumes legumes and pulses including baked beans kidney beans chick peas lentils and split peas can help lower cholesterol levels the most recent australian health survey found fewer than one in five australians ate them on the day of the survey the results of 26 randomised control trials the gold standard of research trials which included 1037 people who had either normal or high cholesterol levels were added together the data showed ldl cholesterol was reduced by 5 percent in response to eating 130 grams of pulses per day this is equivalent to one small can or about a third of a 400 gram large can of baked beans pulses are high in vegetable protein and fibre they lower blood cholesterol in a number of ways the soluble and insoluble fibres assist with lowering cholesterol absorption in the gut while they promote growth of beneficial gut bacteria in the large bowel legumes and pulses take longer to digest compared to processed foods this means you tend to eat less when theyre part of a meal 2 eat plant sterols margarines and spreads plant sterols or phytosterols are chemically similar to blood cholesterol and are found in some plant foods including nuts they are concentrated from plant sources and then added to some commonly eaten foods such as margarines spreads or milk plant sterols compete with two other types of cholesterol for absorption from the gut premade cholesterol which is found in some foods like prawns and cholesterol which is made in your liver this competition process lowers the total amount of cholesterol that eventually ends up in your blood a review concluded that two grams of plant sterols a day leads to an 810 percent reduction in ldl cholesterol the type of fat the plant sterols are mixed with is important a metaanalysis of 32 randomised control trials involving around 2100 people found bigger reductions in total cholesterol a mix of good and bad types and ldl cholesterol when plant sterols were added to margarines or spreads derived from canola or rapeseed oil rather than sunflower or soybean oil 3 eat nuts nuts are high in protein and fat but the amounts of polyunsaturated monounsaturated and saturated fat vary in a review of 25 intervention trials eating approximately 67g of nuts a day about half a cup led to a 51 percent reduction in total cholesterol and 74 percent for ldl it didnt matter what type of nuts people ate the more nuts the bigger the cholesterol reduction people with higher ldl cholesterol at baseline or who were not overweight had a bigger improvement one caution is that half a cup of nuts contains about 400 calories 1600kj so you need to eat nuts instead of another food or eat less each day but have them every day 4 use olive oil olive oil is a major component of the mediterranean diet and the predominant source of fat olive oil contains a high proportion of monounsaturated fat more than 80 percent of olive oils healthy compounds called phenolic compounds are lost during the refining process so less refined varieties such as virgin olive oil are a better choice a review of eight trials that included 350 people consuming high phenolic olive oil found medium effects on lowering blood pressure and small effects on lowering oxidised ldl a type of ldl with no significant effects on total or ldl cholesterol in contrast another trial randomly selected over 7400 men and women at high risk of heart disease to follow three diets the mediterranean diet plus extravirgin olive oil or mediterranean diet plus nuts or a control diet low fat after 48 years followup those in both the olive oil and nut groups had a 30 percent lower risk of heart attack stroke or death from heart disease compared to controls in a recent trial 47 men and women were randomised to substitute 45 percent of their usual foodintake of olive oil or butter for five weeks and then crossed over to the other group for another five weeks researchers found total cholesterol and ldlcholesterol levels were significantly higher after consuming butter compared to olive oil the reduction was biggest in those who had high blood cholesterol to start with switching to a healthier spread makes sense for those with high cholesterol 5 avoid junk food in our study we found people were able to make a number of smaller changes across a range of the foods that lower blood cholesterol levels including increasing nuts soy foods and plant sterols but the biggest change people made was cutting back on energydense nutrientpoor foods junk foods and eating a wider variety of healthy foods the benefits of making these changes they lowered their cholesterol lost weight and lowered their blood pressure a big study examined changes in diet quality scores and heart disease risk in 29000 men from the health professionals followup study and 51 000 women from the nurses health study 19862010 after four years of followup almost 11000 people had a heart disease event those who had the biggest improvement in their diet quality score had a 78

              " 'Summarize:condition: here ’ s what happens when you give 1000 to someone in extreme poverty paragraph: here ’ s what happens when you give 1000 to someone in extreme poverty margaret osuma oshien from siaya kenya — a person who received just under 1000 cash unconditionally from givedirectlyorg my wife adrienne and i are longtime supporters of unconditional cash giving from handing 5 to a homeless person on the street in manhattan to raising 450 to give to a working father of one in rural south africa — we believe in the virtues of sharing abundance in an empowering fashion that enables people to decide how best to allocate their resources themselves when we found givedirectly in november 2015 an org that gives 1000 unconditionally to people who are in extreme poverty as a solution to get them out of extreme poverty we fell in love unconditional — they can do anything they want with it — which is incredibly empowering to recipients but many people in ‘ the west ’ think it ’ s riskyor even foolish we ’ ve told countless friends and family about givedirectly and the concept of transferring cash is met with much skepticism soliciting responses such as eh i only give people food and others such as how do they make sure people aren ’ t defrauding them or stealing the cash i bet most people waste or squander the cash it probably doesn ’ t have longterm impact such as building a school could general angst about the savior barbie complex where western people go out to save people in poor countries by telling them what they should do — often a selfserving endeavor and more after dealing with the frequent barrage of opposing views but always holding strong to our personal convictions we decided to dig for some more answers — and see how many of these holes they were poking in our own justifications could be filled since we currently travel abroad fulltime and kenya is an incredible country we decided to head out for a field visit and take a real peek under the hood of gd ’ s operation outside of givedirectly ’ s country headquarters in kisumu kenya in august 2016 my wife and i visited givedirectly ’ s office in kisumu kenya and spent two 10hour days in the field visiting real past recipients in the siaya where president obama ’ s grandmother lives and homa bay regions after meeting the team on the ground and hearing about their day to day work we were really surprised and impressed by five main things that actually directly addressed a lot of the negative feedback we ’ ve heard in the past the vast majority of the team are local kenyans only two of around 80 or so employees are expats we think that ’ s fantastic since we ’ ve already known that 91 of the cash that we personally give to gd goes directly into the field but actually a solid portion of the 9 administrative cost actually funnels into creating local jobs that afford hundreds more people in east africa the opportunity to build bright futures for themselves there ’ s a huge unemployment issue in kenya and other east african countries and foreign investment is still far behind demand so this kind of job creation has a huge impact on the community beyond the employment opportunity the real incredible moments for us came when we had the chance to speak individually with a few of the locals on the team candidly they are all proud to be working their asses off to improve the lives of people in their own community we even heard two separate stories from some seniorlevel guys still under 30 years old who were driven to work at givedirectly after having their own first real exposure to abject poverty even just a few miles from where they lived they were moved to make a difference to pour their energy every day into giving other people in their community better lives cavin oginga from kenya — a field ops manager for givedirectly — who applied for a job there after running a research project on givedirectly ’ s work for povertyactionorg and seeing what a massive impact they were having one of the most interesting stories we heard was about a young woman who received a cash transfer from givedirectly in 2014 she used a large portion of the transfer to cover her school fees so that she could complete her schooling and then graduated and immediately sought employment she applied to work for givedirectly gd often has 200–600 applicants for any one vacancy and she got the job from living off of less than one dollar a day to now being employed in one of the most competitive roles available the cash transfer from givedirectly has completely altered the path of her life and she will reach heights that only two years ago she would have thought to be completely unattainable for her 2 there was really no savior barbie complex in the givedirectly operation — no one is coming in from wealthy nations and telling anyone else how to live their own lives and what ’ s best for them and no one here is swooping in from some rich country on a selfserving mission ‘ save the world ’ 3 auditing — the rigor behind this operation is crazy they have 5 separate teams of people for each stage in the transfer process — from initial outreach through final followup the recipients almost never see the same people so there ’ s no nepotism and absolutely everything is audited 4 let ’ s face it — ‘ data ’ is boring and unsexy yet it ’ s likely the most powerful foundation for any forprofit or charitable organization to build upon givedirectly is almost annoying with how datacentric they are every decision literally every single question we asked them about why they do or do not do something was backed by data and we ’ re not talking about just any old data we ’ re talking about peerreviewed audited and randomized controlled trials rcts — the holy grail of i ’ m right and you ’ re wrong not that they carry that swagger on their shoulder whatsoever i ’ m humblebragging on their behalf but if they ’ re doing something it ’ s because their data and 3 other independent sources ’ data has proven that ’ s the right decision 5 the ‘ mission ’ per se of how gd gives isn ’ t about funding what they believe will have the most ‘ profitable ’ result rather funding is based on who has the greatest need basically it ’ s the ultimate anti ruthless capitalism i loved hearing that ie not favoring a 22 year old with a bunch of entrepreneurial ideas over a 35 yo single mother of 4 richard aura ongari from homa bay kenya sits inside of the small tworoom mud hut that he build with part of his cash transfer from givedirectly the majority of his transfer has been spent on medication for a chronic illness before being able to afford the medication richard could not walk but now that he ’ s being treated you can find him marching all around his property and enjoying his life with his children and grandchildren now for the meat of it — we went into small kenyan villages and met these people who ’ ve taken a cash transfer of 1000 3 installments over a year here ’ s the breakdown of how their money was spent 1 housing — everyone that we met improved their housing situation in some way they were fixing the following core issues and fyi we didn ’ t see a single home that was larger than 20 feet by 20 feet that size home would house 5–9 people this small mud shack is home to 5 before receiving his 1000 transfer from givedirectly samwel odhimbo orimba and his family lived homeless on the shores of lake victoria in homa bay kenya this house where you can see through the walls is a major upgrade for this incredibly grateful and loving family a thatched roof — which leaks in every rain and must be replaced every 1–3 years i completely sleepless nights who can sleep getting rained on ii leads to frequent illness sometimes chronic and death iii leads to missed frequently school for children iv leads to missed work and income b no home — living with 4–8 people in a 10x12 one or two room mud hut c upgrading home — living in a mud hut with holes in the walls d dirt floor in home — constant insect infestation including jigas which burrow in your feet causing crippling pain 2 school fees — after primary school kenyans have to pay 6070 per 3month semester for school given that people in extreme poverty often earn less than 5 a day for a family of 2–4 kids that meager amount can be a mountain forcing thousands of kids to miss out on school from 5 or 6 years old and onwards 3 children of givedirectly recipient eunice awino omondi and 5 of their friends all living in siaya kenya where president obama ’ s grandmother lives eunice ’ s children are now much healthier because they can sleep through the night under a steel roof and not thatched grass that keeps them up and cold when it rains 3 food — probably the saddest of expenditures in my opinion but a lot of people that we met were purchasing a few month ’ s worth of corn to feed their families i see it as the saddest because such a basic need that ’ s consumed and gone without perpetual benefits bags of corn purchased with a portion of a cash transfer from givedirectly that sit in the recipients doorway living room foyer childrens ’ bedroom guest ’ s bedroom 4 other — outside of those top three which everyone seemed to have spent at least some portion of their transfer on people purchased medicines for chronic illness cancer hiv etc livestock for income and clothing shoes 5 i ’ ll hide this little gem in here many skeptics think that large portions of the transfers will be wasted on vices like alcohol drugs or tobacco or that the sudden influx of cash may increase a person ’ s propensity to seek these substances however there is no evidence that vice consumption is different from others in the community who did not receive transfers with gd ’ s rigorous measurement and auditing they find the effect on vice spending tobacco alcohol etc is negative and insignificant meaning there is no statistically significant effect on vice consumptionhere is the 3rd party study conducted by princetonedu this finding is consistent with a publication from world bank on vice spending and cash transfers that surveyed dozens of studies from around the world now this ended up being a pretty diverse array of purchases considering that half were from one little village and half from another and for us it just highlights the variety of need that exists within any small community i think that if an organization went in to build clean water wells offered solar panels mosquito nets donate clothes built schools or built houses — only a fraction of the gross value of the investment would be felt by the people in the community shoving a square peg of charity into a round hole of need this is exactly why we believe in giving cash and why we believe in givedirectly of course these people still have needs for more but i can confidently say that 91 of what we give them goes directly to people who need it most and 97 of that cash transfer served immediate needs in their lives and i don ’ t think other ngos can say the same i think a more open and participatory conversation on eradicating extreme poverty is critical in this day and age extreme poverty sits at the bottom of maslow ’ s hierarchy of needs and contributes to massive issues all the way up the pyramid leading to widespread health epidemics overpopulation lack of education lack of environmental and conservational awareness increased violence and pollution we ’ re all connected and the more people who live in dignity the better off we can all be do you think cash transfers are a terrible idea do you know of a better way',\n",

darlings coming out this year but you also starred in the toronto international film festival debuts horns and the f word its not easy to redefine yourself from harry potter but it appears its happening i think it depends on the attitude you take towards it basically if you say yes potter was the biggest thing that im ever going to do and im never going to come close to that again and its going to hold me back from getting parts then probably all of those things will come true but if you take the attitude that this is the most amazing platform in a way to get set for a career in the world its an amazing start to have had and its something that can be capitalized on rather than being something that holds you back and i just have such fun doing my job as well like the most interesting way for me to do it is by picking diverse varied things like the f word and kill your darlings and i think theres definitely an element of you grow up for 10 years on a set and you dont really have peers when youre 12 or 13 that you look to in other films when youre 16 or 17 you start becoming aware of guys like aaron johnson or eddie redmayne or ben whishaw or james mcavoy and you start being fans of them and you also start kind of going oh i want to do what theyre doing i want to have loads of different parts as well so it builds up this desire to get out there the woman in black felt like its narrative was basically heres daniel radcliffes first postpotter role and now with these people have moved on i think thats a really astute observation i think thats completely true the woman in black was a fantastic transition because it wasnt so different than harry that people were like oh hes just trying to shock us but it was different enough that people realized it was a different reason to go and see it and the fact that it did so well and it was a really good movie i may not be over the moon with my own performance in it theres still stuff i see when i see that thats very reminiscent of harry i only started filming it six weeks or something after we finished the last potter so it came very soon after but i do think now with these next three films people will see it is so different from anything ive done before i just think ive grown up a lot as an actor in the last couple of years and i think as a consequence my works gotten better and im just looking forward to people finally seeing it because i feel like ive been talking about this film for ages and now people will get to verify for themselves and youre playing a guy who is part of a group that despises mainstream tastes laughs yes yeah i know what you mean but you know i think thats what i liked about potter and thats what im still very proud of about potter even though it was the most commercial series in the world in terms of the money it made and the appeal it had we always did try to make them as challenging as possible i think the reason im so proud of it still is that we made eight films that got better and better and better until the last one thats not very often achieved in film and the fact we achieved it is a testament to the amount of care and love put into it by everyone who was involved on that set all the time so yeah i still think we did a remarkable thing and even if we were very mainstream which of course we were we brought a lot of integrity and sort of a boldness to the franchise because when i was growing up i dont remember people talking about franchises before i was in one i remember people talking about lord of the rings and potter would be like franchises thats the first time i remember last time we spoke you mentioned you had never watched star wars yes well except for the phantom menace lets not tell anyone that you have to catch up before episode vii comes out i know i know i do i have to catch up before that because fucking all of my friends are working on the new one because star wars is filming in leavesden there was at least one guy digby milner who worked on all the potters who had also worked on star wars the originals and he will be working on new star wars at leavesdon as well and it is kind of amazing because star wars the originals were made in england as well so theres a lot of that crew who well basically have a huge amount of sons and daughters of the original crew who are now on the new star wars movie its come full circle thats all they do at leavesdon apparently is franchises laughs kill your darlings is interesting because it involves famous people in a story thats really not that well known i mean i didnt know the story at all i really wasnt aware of it thats one of the things thats so cool about it and cool about reading the script for the first time is you just go wow when you have a story that is this fascinating about a group of characters that is this well known and yet this story has really never been told you start of just feel like this is buried treasure weve struck allen ginsberg wanted to write a book about this at one point and he was told not to absolutely lucien for reasons you understand when you see the film did not want anyone to know this story but i definitely think that was one of the fascinating things about it people didnt know and one of the things i think people will like about this film that i think perhaps they wont expect is that when you hear 1940s beat poet historical drama you sort of think oh that sounds quite dry but its actually a lot of fun as well i dont think you can make a movie about the beats without having fun because they had a great fucking time this might be a bad comparison but its got a superhero origin story feel to it only with writers oh ive said that a lot like when were introduced to jack kerouac it felt dramatic and the first time we see allens name in the film is on his university application director john krokidas loved the idea of taking this famous persons name but actually seeing it in the context of them applying to university what was your reaction when you heard jk rowling was revisiting the harry potter universe with fantastic beasts where to find them were you surprised i had never heard her say no i dont think any of us would ever be foolish enough to you know say never but i think with jo i wasnt really surprised it kind of made sense to me actually when it was announced because i was kind of like ok yeah shes gone off and had casual vacancy and then done the robert galbraith books and both have been very successful and i imagine that has given her a confidence of oh ok now that i stepped away from it i can actually go back to it with confidence and i think she recognizes that there is still a huge hunger out there for more sides of the potter world and yeah shes wants to give people what they want and i think it will be really good im just relieved that its in her hands to be honest that lets me know that its not anyone just cashing in and its going to be authentic she doesnt need the money she definitely doesnt need the money mike ryan is senior writer for huffington post entertainment you can contact him directly on twitter',\n",

experienced how food and drinks can affect their energy and alertness with as many as 35 of american adults suffering from symptoms of insomnia it ’ s understandable that there ’ s a strong desire to take advantage of food and drinks for better sleep both diet and sleep are complex which means there ’ s no silver bullet or single food that is guaranteed to help with sleep however there are some foods and drinks that may make it easier to get a great night ’ s sleep specific foods that can affect sleep researchers including nutritionists and sleep experts have conducted different types of studies to try to discover the best foods for sleep while this research provides important clues it ’ s not conclusive in general there ’ s a lack of direct evidence about specific foods that are good for sleep in addition the range of varieties of cultivars of most foods means that their nutrient profile can be inconsistent for example some varieties of red grapes have high levels of melatonin while others have virtually none climate and growing conditions may further alter the nutrients in any particular food product that said there are indications that certain foods can make you sleepy or promote better sleep sometimes this is based on a particular research study and in other cases on the underlying nutritional components of the food or drink dietary choices affect more than just energy and sleepiness they can play a major role in things like weight cardiovascular health and blood sugar levels just to name a few for that reason it ’ s best to consult with a doctor or dietician before making significant changes to your daily diet doing so helps ensure that your food choices support not just your sleep but all of your other health priorities as well kiwi the kiwi or kiwifruit is a small ovalshaped fruit popularly associated with new zealand even though it is grown in numerous countries there are both green and gold varieties but green kiwis are produced in greater numbers kiwifruit possess numerous vitamins and minerals most notably vitamins c and e as well as potassium and folate some research has found that eating kiwi can improve sleep in a study people who ate two kiwis one hour before bedtime found that they fell asleep faster slept more and had better sleep quality it is not known for sure why kiwis may help with sleep but researchers believe that it could relate to their antioxidant properties ability to address folate deficiencies andor high concentration of serotonin tart cherries and tart cherry juice as the name indicates tart cherries have a distinct flavor from sweet cherries sometimes called sour cherries these include cultivars like richmond montmorency and english morello they may be sold whole or as a tart cherry juice several studies have found sleep benefits for people who drink tart cherry juice in one study people who drank two onecup servings of tart cherry juice per day were found to have more total sleep time and higher sleep efficiency these benefits may come from the fact that tart cherries have been found to have aboveaverage concentrations of melatonin which is a hormone that helps regulate circadian rhythm and promote healthy sleep tart cherries may also have an antioxidant effect that is conducive to sleep malted milk and nighttime milk malted milk is made by combining milk and a specially formulated powder that contains primarily wheat flour malted wheat and malted barley along with sugar and an assortment of vitamins it is popularly known as horlick ’ s the name of a popular brand of malted milk powder in the past small studies found that malted milk before bed reduced sleep interruptions the explanation for these benefits is uncertain but may have to do with the b and d vitamins in malted milk milk itself contains melatonin and some milk products are melatoninenriched when cows are milked at night their milk has more melatonin and this milk may be useful in providing a natural source of the sleepproducing hormone fatty fish a research study found that fatty fish may be a good food for better sleep the study over a period of months found that people who ate salmon three times per week had better overall sleep as well as improved daytime functioning researchers believe that fatty fish may help sleep by providing a healthy dose of vitamin d and omega3 fatty acids which are involved in the body ’ s regulation of serotonin this study focused particularly on fish consumption during winter months when vitamin d levels tend to be lower nuts nuts like almonds walnuts pistachios and cashews are often considered to be a good food for sleep though the exact amounts can vary nuts contain melatonin as well as essential minerals like magnesium and zinc that are essential to a range of bodily processes in a clinical trial using supplements it was found that a combination of melatonin magnesium and zinc helped older adults with insomnia get better sleep rice studies of carbohydrate intake and sleep have had mixed results overall but some evidence connects rice consumption with improved sleep a study of adults in japan found that those who regularly ate rice reported better sleep than those who ate more bread or noodles this study only identified an association and can not demonstrate causality but it supports prior research that showed that eating foods with a high glycemic index around four hours before bedtime helped with falling asleep at the same time sugary beverages and sweets have been tied to worse sleep so it appears that not all carbohydrates and high glycemic index foods are created equal additional research is necessary to fully identify the sleeprelated effects of different carbohydrates the impact of carbohydrates on sleep may be influenced by what is consumed with them for example a combination of a moderate amount protein that has tryptophan a sleeppromoting amino acid and carbohydrates may make it easier for the tryptophan to reach the brain turkey is an example of a protein with high levels of tryptophan',\n",

              " 'Summarize:condition: fertility expert reveals the pregnancy etiquette everyone should follow paragraph: when someone tells you they are pregnant it might feel natural to touch their bump or comment on how big they are getting but although these comments are not intentionally rude insensitive or inappropriate they can easily come across the wrong way to a woman who is on a hormonal roller coaster so what should you be saying to your friend who is expecting midwife fertility guru zita west who has helped thousands of women get pregnant and looked after celebrities including kate winslet and sophie wessex during their pregnancies shares her advice 1 dont touch her bump invading peoples personal space is not normal etiquette for everyday life you wouldnt rub or touch someones belly on a normal day so why is this any different if you really want to you can politely ask if you can touch someones pregnant belly but dont be offended if they say no as this is one of the most annoying and uncomfortable moments for pregnant woman if her baby is kicking and she wants you to have a feel shell invite you to 2 dont ask if she has chosen a name this might not seem like a big deal but it can be to those who havent thought of a name yet or those that have but feel that they might be bombarded with judgmental opinions gone are the days when we would name our child john or jane in recent times theres been a general trend to more creative names such as wolf or apple problems arise when she tells you what shes going to name her child and you cant resist sharing all your opinions on why this is a good or bad decision hearing opinions from everyone else is stressful for mothers to be its easier to not ask about the name and just wait for her to announce it once the baby is born ive found that all children seem to perfectly fit their names in time even if it might sound a strange or unusual name at first 3 dont look shocked when you hear shes pregnant this often happens with women i see who are also in high flying jobs when they say they are pregnant their friends and colleagues jaws drop open and they get things like but youre such a career woman or i didnt think you were maternal people can be ambitious and be mums its not one or the other whether or not youve seen her maternal side doesnt mean she doesnt have one and whether or not you think she fits into the classic mould of a maternal woman doesnt mean she wont be a brilliant mother 4 dont tell her shes getting bigger and bigger while seeing a friends bump grow can be really exciting dont comment on the size or shape many of the most clueless comments that annoy pregnant woman come from people subtly judging them for packing on pregnancy pounds a pregnant woman is aware that she is growing so theres no need to be constantly reminding her that shes huge big or massive even if shes looking a large she doesnt need to hear it 5 dont tell her shes not big enough following on from the previous comment it is also not nice to tell someone they look small or ask them are you gaining enough weight you may think youre paying a mamatobe a compliment when you say youre so tiny or i can barely see your belly but you may only be making her worry about the development and growth of her baby 6 dont congratulate her on social media if someone tells you theyre pregnant they have chosen to tell you and not your friends family and random followers on social media the decision on when to announce a pregnancy is not up to you therefore dont instantly go to congratulate them on social media because you might share friends that they havent told yet or they simply might be keeping the news under wraps until they feel ready 7 dont act like shes sick although pregnancy is in a way a medical condition pregnancy is not an illness pregnant woman can still have fun go out exercise and more attend meetings head departments and in todays day and age where so many women are doing multiple things like running businesses building extensions and becoming mothers they last thing they want is to be treated differently every woman is different some may have severe symptoms some may find pregnancy a breeze only they are aware of their limits and how much they can take that said pregnancy can make women tired so do offer her a seat on the tube 8 dont tell her labour horror stories whenever anyones having a baby others love to share stories of their own experiences of labour but telling a pregnant woman about your two day labour that ended in emergency csection and you losing half the blood in your body is not helpful labour is a process and the great news is that in todays world with all our wonderful medical advances and pain control most women get through it and usually once the baby arrives memories of labour fade away it is genuinely terrifying for a woman pregnant with her first child to hear labour horror stories so dont share them 9 do tell her shes going to be just fine pregnancy can be a scary time for women their lives are about to change and many fear how they will thinkfeelcope on the other side the bottom line is that all women try their best and most women even those who worry they might not be natural mothers adapt once their children arrive it might take some longer than others to take to motherhood but that is understandable as theres a lot to take on as a mother in terms of looking after a baby and juggling whatever it is they will have to juggle whether thats other children elderly relatives high flying careers evening courses husbands and everything else if you throw in fear of postpartum depression and then the very real experience of having postpartum depression its no wonder women feel overwhelmed and anxious about what lies ahead but ive met thousands of mothers over the years and you know theyve nearly all been absolutely fine grown into their new role admirably coped well and become wonderful parents this is what she needs to hear',\n",

headphones because how dare she and no it isn ’ t a parody you can read it in its full entitled glory or stick with me as i dissect each grubby jawdropping delusion of psychopathic awfulness it ’ s going to be quite a ride how to talk to a woman who is wearing headphones these days many women walk around playing with a smartphone or tablet device and are often wearing headphones and listening to music at the same time yet that doesn ’ t mean you can ’ t talk to them of course not all women are open to being approached because not all women are single and looking however if a woman wearing headphones is single and hoping to meet a boyfriend or even a new lover she will almost always be happy to take off her headphones to give you an opportunity to create a spark with her the author one dan bacon could have saved us all a lot of bother here by answering his how to with don ’ t sadly he seems to have missed some basic behavioural science here you see the very reason i and many other women wear headphones isn ’ t as a trivial obstacle to some throbbing hormone mountain nor as a challenge for those blessed with an abundance of ego it ’ s a defence a defence against the aural onslaught of modern life and especially the leering advances of said throbbing hormone mountains in short we wear them because we don ’ t want to be talked to it ’ s basic physics really we fill our ear holes to stop you from getting in but back to dan what to do to get her attention 1 stand in front of her with 1 to 15 meters between you 2 have a relaxed easygoing smile 3 is she hasn ’ t already looked up at you simply get her attention with a wave of your hand wave your hand in her direct line of vision so she can ’ t ignore it 4 when she looks at you smile and point to her headphones and say take off your headphones for a minute and pretend to be taking headphones off your head so she fully understands if she doesn ’ t understand most women will simply gesture that you want to talk to her by briefly pointing back and forth from you to her and say i want to talk to you for a minute in most cases you won ’ t have to go to that extreme but some girls are shy and will be hesitant to take the headphones off right away because they are feeling a lot of nervousness and excitement about what is happening 5 then do what we call acknowledging the awkwardness by quickly mentioning something about the awkwardness of the moment see the conversation example below to demonstrate you understand that approaching a woman in this way isn ’ t the most common of experiences for either party this helps put her at ease and know that you are a cool guy who she can relax and open up to i don ’ t know if these five steps are a common thing but i have personally experienced this several times at step 1 i know what you are doing and i ’ m ignoring you hoping the ground will open up and take one of us to the depths of somewhere hellish which would be more pleasant than this situation is developing to be by step 3 i ’ m not feeling excited and i ’ m not feeling flattered as dan later tells his readers i will be i ’ m feeling harassed straight up dictionary definition harassed by step 4 i ’ ve learnt that you can ’ t understand a basic body language brushoff and are therefore a direct threat to my personal safety my brain is in fight or flight checking for escape routes it ’ s

jedi mind trick to bludgeon a woman from her blissful state of aural security you smile in a friendly confident manner hey – i know it ’ s not normal for people to talk to someone with headphones in but i was walking along and saw you and thought – wow she ’ s a cutie i have to say hi i ’ m dan what ’ s your name woman usually flattered by the compliment and impressed by your confidence to approach her like that jessica you add in some humor coolnice to meet you jessica i don ’ t normally talk to girls with headphones but your big green headphones were just calling out to me woman most likely laughing smiling and enjoying the interaction you let her know that you have something to dosomewhere to go so she understands that you ’ re not going to stand there talking to her for 30 minutes anyway so i ’ m just out doing a bit of shopping at the moment i ’ m on my way to a store up the street how ’ s your day going so far in his scenario jessica has just been waiting her whole life to be blessed with the attention of a complete stranger who mistakes hunched shoulders darting eyes and rictus for laughing and smiling here ’ s how it plays out in real life trust me i ’ ve been it seen it and spoken to the survivors him i see you don ’ t want to be talked to but i find you physically attractive and i ’ m making that your problem her please leave me alone him f you you stuck up b i didn ’ t fancy you anyway with advice like this out there it ’ s hardly any surprise is it these lonely men so desperately in search of conquests have been given permission blessed with the entitlement to go forth and pluck their bounty using but five humble steps so imagine their horror and indignation when that which has been promised doesn ’ t want to be plucked and tells them to sling their greasy hook next dan lists the five mistakes men make when approaching a woman who is wearing headphones sadly not one of them is to sod right off points 1 4 and 5 are fairly inoffensive generic dating guff be confident be engaging be flirty but oh boy just try and get your noggin round points 2 and 3 2 allowing her to ignore him headphones are a great barrier between a person and the rest of the world that being said if a guy wants to get a woman ’ s attention he needs to show confidence by being determined to get her to stop listening to the music and chat to him to him if a guy has a weak vibe or presence about him a woman usually won ’ t give in to his request for her to remove the headphones women love to test guys to see how confident they really are and a favorite test of women is to ignore a guy ’ s attempts to converse with her and see what he will do next will he walk away in shame or will he remain calm and continue talking to her in a confident easygoing manner this is her way of gauging his interest in her and also a way of determining whether he is mentally and emotionally strong enough for a girl like her if a guy gives up at the first sign of resistance most women will be turned off by his mental and emotional weakness as a man 3 allowing her to take control of the interaction no matter how confident or challenging a woman might behave she still dreams of meeting a guy who is more confident than her a woman doesn ’ t want to be forced to control an interaction with a guy ie call the shots boss him around but she will if she has to controlling an interaction with a woman is not about bossing her around being arrogant or being too assertive instead you simply need to assume the role of the man and let her be the woman in other words make her feel girly around you because you think behave and feel your vibe so masculine the advice here is basically no doesn ’ t mean no it means keep going until you get what you want the screaming will stop eventually because apparently that ’ s what women want and forms the basis for a million rape defence cases trust me when we tell you to go away we aren ’ t testing your measure as a man we ’ re testing how quickly your legs can carry you in an offward direction put dan ’ s advice into any other scenario for the true jawdrop factor shopkeepers may lock their doors at night but if you want a pint of milk just hammer on the door until they open up they ’ ll be flattered i appreciate the world of mating is hard but please for the love of humanity learn this just because you want doesn ’ t mean you can have women are not commodities to be hunted and won and if you have no luck finding someone to bump pink bits with that ’ s your problem not our fault for not adhering to the playbook rules it ’ s a playbook we never signed up for and it ’ s only a game if both teams actually know they ’ re playing nowhere in his advice does dan tell his frustrated manbabies how to handle rejection with grace because the advice is simply not to accept it this attitude is why i and countless other women have been been chased down the street followed home physically restrained spat at verbally abused and generally made to feel like garbage merely for trying to exist so when i hear the whiny pissbabies ask when am i allowed to approach hot single women simple if a woman has her headphones in the answer is never and before you bleat on about ooh what if there ’ s a fire she ’ ll smell it even through all your bullst if you ’ re in a bar or party her flirtatious smile may be the comeon you ’ re looking for but be prepared to accept that you read it wrong politely wish her a good evening and toddle back off out of her life without 20 minutes of awkward pawing insisting she let you buy her a rohypnoltini but how about this take up a hobby ask your friends if they know of someone looking to date or brace yourself for a whopper of a revelation if you ’ re looking for a horde of single

these promising games but some games capture the imaginations of gamers more than others and sometimes those games seem like they ’ ll never come out here are five games that have either been announced or strongly implied games that people are chomping at the bit to play — games we ’ ve been waiting on for a very long time 5 beyond good evil 2 the original beyond good evil came out in 2003 it ’ s a unique game that stars jade an investigative reporter who ’ s working on a case about a planetwide alien conspiracy she can kick serious butt when the situation dictates but she ’ s also

wellreceived by critics and a cult fan base has been vocal enough that a sequel was announced in 2008 in the years since an hd remake of the original came out in 2011 but we haven ’ t heard much about

third official installment instead sticking to prequels remakes and — some would say — filler never fear a third installment is on its way and it ’ s coming only to playstation 4 and xbox one no

well final fantasy once the leading series of japanese roleplaying games has fallen on somewhat hard times the 13th installment in particular didn ’ t exactly light the world on fire in fact most fans of the series would agree that it ’ s been a slow downhill slide since final fantasy x came out in 2001 developer square enix is looking to fix that tarnished reputation by releasing a big important game for the series ’ 15th installment and judging by the trailer and the demo that released alongside final fantasy typeo hd they ’ re on the right track will the finished product live up to expectations for that we ’ ll have to wait and see when we might see it november 29 2016 2 the last guardian many longtime playstation gamers have a strong connection to the works of team ico so far the developer has only released two titles ico and shadow of the colossus but they ’ re both singular beautiful games that have made a lasting impression the last guardian is team ico ’ s next project first announced with this trailer in 2009 the game was scheduled to come out in 2011 but it never made it to market fans finally got a fresh look at the game at e3 2015 and some members of the press have even been able to play small chunks of it despite assurances that it ’ ll launch in 2016 many fans are still skeptical when we might see it sometime in 2016 hopefully 1 halflife 3 if there ’ s one game more famous for not existing than the last guardian it ’ s halflife 3 if you haven ’ t played the other halflife games you might be wondering what the big deal is first off it ’ s a terrific series of shooters that tells a great story in fact the series really laid the groundwork for all storybased shooters to come it ’ s no stretch to say that the original halflife was probably the first shooter to tell a story worth following at all making matters worse however is that the last installment halflife 2 episode two which came out in 2007 ended on a major cliffhanger but instead of continuing that series and playing off that story ’ s big ol ’ hanging thread valve shifted its efforts to the also excellent portal series by now the demand for halflife 3 has reached such a fever pitch that even if valve does eventually deliver the game it couldn ’ t possibly live up to expectations but do us a solid anyway valve — give us halflife 3 when we might see it no idea and there ’ s no evidence that it ’ s in development',\n",

              " 'Summarize:condition: mad men star took 10 years to make this movie paragraph: after years of playing roger sterling on amc ’ s mad men john slattery is comfortable with a drink in his hand sitting on a leather couch in park city utah with a bloody mary by his side slattery talks less about the ad men of the 1960s and more about the first film that he directed god ’ s pocket which premiered at this years sundance film festival the dark comedy needs a better adjective than dark because most of the film reveals deeplyrooted sadness disappointment and failures – carried out to perfection by a dreamteam cast that includes philip seymour hoffman christina hendricks richard jenkins and john turturro slattery has directed five episodes of mad men but this is his first attempt at a feature based on the theater ’ s applause on opening night his future as a director certainly looks bright the huffington post joined slattery couchside to find out why it took 10 years to make this happen how surfing keeps him from getting a little screwy and why he refused to be in front of the camera this time warning plot spoilers throughout when did you originally come across the material for god ’ s pocket i read the book by pete dexter about 10 years ago and tried to get the rights to it but it ’ s a good thing i didn ’ t get the rights because i probably wouldnt be able to actually make a good movie then i tried getting the rights but someone else owned them so i let it go about five years later someone reminded me of it and asked whatever happened to that book turns out the rights were then available so i said all right i ’ m going to outline this thing because i had written a shitty screenplay in between and i didn ’ t want to do that again i did an outline about 100 pages long and kind of just dumped everything from the book into it i said okay let ’ s go get the rights and then they came back to us and said that they had made a mistake the rights were not available same people still owned it after you had put all that time into it i was making the adjustment bureau at the time and was sitting in a trailer for a large chunk of the day so it was like are you going to watch tv or do this when i was told i couldn ’ t have it i thought well if they have owned this thing for so long and haven ’ t done anything with it i ’ m just going to write it anyway and if someone else makes it first fine eventually bob gersh from the gersh agency worked out the deal do you think it made the project that much more appealing because you couldn ’ t have it at first it sort of alleviated the pressure of a production deal or deadline in a way when you ’ re sitting around like actors do and you start to go crazy because you need an outlet i would do this at the end of the day i ’ d put in a few hours and crank it around a little bit and i wouldn ’ t feel crazy that day do you have a different itch that ’ s satisfied by writing versus acting it ’ s the same if i were acting in a play or directing creative people go on vacation and four days in you ’ re like i got ta get out of here i have a lot of energy so i ’ m told i surf a lot you live in la half the time for mad men we ’ re in new york so i have a place i go surfing in long island isn ’ t that freezing in the winter it is but there ’ s all kinds of gear now it ’ s like skiing almost if i sit around and do nothing for a while i get a little screwy what did you find most compelling about the material in god ’ s pocket what made you want to make this film it ’ s very visual which appealed to me i sort of see things in pictures i don ’ t know whether that makes me dumb or smart like a kid almost and the dialogue by which i mean the characters just the way they expressed themselves was interesting it was a simple to the point way of saying things without saying everything the book is very interior it takes place in mickey ’ s head which was difficult to do in a film you have to show that you can ’ t tell it that was a challenge mickey ’ s state of mind and his anxiety in hanging on to this woman that he feels lucky to be with he feels that if i lose this woman then i ’ ll never get anybody else like that i think there ’ s a sentence that says he realized that would be the last woman he would ever get without paying for it so even though she might not be in love with him anymore he doesn ’ t really belong in this place he has no affinity for this place he just has this woman what i think you get from christina ’ s performance is the disappointment she feels he ’ s not picking up on the signals of what she needs you see them having sex and obviously that ’ s not going very well he can ’ t express himself and she needs something she needs to find out what happened to her son she needs him to step up and do the right thing and he ’ s trying but they ’ re missing each other did you consider acting in the film no i got asked if i was going to and every time i said no people were like good idea laughs which i was like what the hell do you mean by that i ask because you ’ ve directed a handful of mad men episodes that ’ s the least sort of fun of the whole thing – being in it some moments where you get relaxed enough where you know the scene have done your homework know the lines and you sit down and it can be really fun because you know what you ’ re doing on one side of the camera and know what you ’ re doing on the other like woody allen i mean i would never even put myself in the same stratosphere but he is woody allen he knows what he knows and he has the time he has ben affleck i have to say i admire the hell out of that guy with a move like argo to direct it and then give that kind of performance i don ’ t know how the hell he dealt with that stress another example of directors starring in movies is here at sundance – zach braff ’ s new film wish i was here i ’ m interested in zach taking 10 years to do this i ’ m sure there are all kinds of reasons – he was acting he was being successful in all kinds of ways i ’ d like to try it sometime but you ’ d have to build in the assurance that you have the proper amount of time so you didn ’ t feel like oh i shouldn ’ t have done this how did you cast this film did you just ask christina hendricks at the water cooler to come be in your movie i went to phil seymour hoffman first you go through the proper channels because you don ’ t want to burden anybody with do me a favor that ’ s a drag i sent him the script and i anticipated that he would let me down easy and say i like it but i don ’ t have time i had sent it with an offer for the part of shelburne he called and said i love the script but i want to play mickey and it took me about two minutes to realize what a great idea that was so i said all right in then i mentioned it to christina because i was directing an episode of mad men and saw her through the monitor and just realized she was the perfect person i hadn ’ t gotten phil to officially commit yet so i said here ’ s the script i ’ d love you to play this part and i hope to get phil she was thrilled i sent it to richard jenkins who is represented by my agent about 45 minutes later he called and said he was in and then john turturro read it and called up and said he was busy doing a movie but that he wanted to do it too i was just floored there ’ s a scene where christina is up on a balcony and the men are below in the street looking up at her she slowly walks inside and that quiet moment really illuminated how much power her character has in this film she condoned this guy being beaten to death because he took advantage of her what i wanted to convey was that this is a woman who knows her currency all these guys know their weight in the world whether it ’ s slapping somebody around or using the way you look to get what you want she knows this guy wants to get in her pants and she wants to find something out she realized in that scene in the field that the way to do that is to let him do what he wants but then he doesn ’ t give her what she wants and in the end she watches him getting beaten in the street and she just walks away letting it happen if she had said stop they would have stopped you mentioned earlier that making this movie 10 years ago would have been very different what do you think you bring to the table now i think just seeing more of everything life you get to a point where you ’ re young and you ’ re an actor and everything is always about if i could just get this if i could only get that and then you start to realize this is my place in the food chain this is what i do well i don ’ t do everything well i can ’ t play everything i ’ m not a movie star i don ’ t want to be a movie star your aspirations become more your own and then it occurs to you to want to put your own foot forward creatively you watch other people do their thing and you think i could do this i can try at this you also realize that there are sophisticated degrees of performing there ’ s actor a b c and then there ’ s phil hoffman and richard jenkins and christina hendricks and john turturro and the fact that they said yes that ’ s also a testament to you but when it really comes down to it it ’ s because you recognize what they do you really recognize what they ’ re capable of doing and i should be so lucky to be able to work with those guys',\n",

              " 'Summarize:condition: here ’ s how to actually make your penis bigger paragraph: just you know in case youre wondering we ’ re not pointing any fingers here but apparently lots of people are turning to google with questions about penis sizes according to a recent analysis of google data by economist seth stephensdavidowitz the top penisrelated search was how to make my penis bigger at buzzfeed health were all about helping you achieve your goals so we decided to do some research about how you can actually do this first lets talk about all those creams pills treatments and surgeries that promise to give you a way longer stronger boner they probably wont work you can only maximize your size to what you ’ re capable of achieving dr harry fisch clinical professor of urology and reproductive medicine at weill cornell medical college and author of the new naked tells buzzfeed life even those penile extenders and stretchers that claim to work over time would actually just be stretching your flaccid length and that has absolutely no correlation to how big you get when hard says fisch so don ’ t waste your money on a product or service that swears it can give you five more inches there ’ s no actual scientific study that they rely on here ’ s the thing says fisch you can increase the size of your penis — visually the way you can do it is by losing weight this is not a trap when you have excess fat around your pubic area and stomach it could make your penis seem smaller if you lose weight you can actually gain an inch or two because the pubic fat would be less says fisch so if youve noticed a little extra weight around that area losing a few might come with the added bonus of looking bigger where you actually want to if youre not sure where to start check out our clean eating challenge and our 28day get fit challenge for some inspiration another way to look bigger trim your pubic hair again not a trick just an aesthetic truth cutting back the hedges will make your penis look longer obviously pubic hair grooming is a personal preference but if you ’ re goal is to be bigger this seems way less painful than some shady penile extender you can buy off the internet then make sure your boner is at maximum capacity because it might not be whatever your maximal length or girth is you can ’ t get it bigger than that says fisch however a lot of men don ’ t meet their potential that ’ s usually because they ’ re not getting enough blood flow to the penis which could be the result of being overweight smoking increased cholesterol high blood pressure diabetes or cardiovascular disease so the first step in your penisgrowing experiment should be to get the rest of your body healthy — especially your cardiovascular system what ’ s good for the heart is good for the penis says fisch and ok yes there are some pills you can take obviously erectile dysfunction meds like viagra and cialis are the most common while they won ’ t necessarily add inches they do increase blood flow to the penis so if you ’ re not getting a firm erection on your own these can help you hit your peak penis length talk to your doctor if you think you could benefit from a prescription supplements can also help like antioxidants to increase your vascular health or larginine to increase nitric oxide and blood flow — both of which can lead to stronger boners says fisch its worth noting here that if youre having problems getting or maintaining an erection or if your erections just arent what they used to be that could be a sign of a bigger health issue like heart disease definitely talk to your doctor if youre experiencing problems like this dont just borrow a few pills from your friends viagra rx all that being said you really shouldn ’ t worry so much about your size anyway seriously first of all if youre feeling illequipped after watching porn — stop comparing your goods to a porn stars the average erect penis is 54 inches and most men fall within an inch of that says fisch chances are youre actually pretty close to average and if youre worrying about your size pleasing your partner remember that penetration is just one part of sex and everyones preferences are different many women dont even orgasm from penilevaginal sex for instance and other people dont care very much about size or length the size of your penis could possibly be unrelated entirely to your partners ability to experience pleasure now let ’ s have an honest conversation about those who do have a smaller than average penis sure you may encounter partners who may be turned off by that as with any physical or sexual preference but you ’ ll also find partners who are turned on by it or who don ’ t care either way it ’ s all about finding the right sexual compatibility with the right partner — and that might include adding more oral stimulation manual stimulation sex toys and so on its 100 entirely possible to have an amazing sex life with any size penis or you know none at all bottom line you cant magically grow a bigger penis and thats ok yes you can make some small health and aesthetic tweaks to have the biggest and hardest penis thats physically possible for you but in the end the best thing you can do for yourself is to worry less about size and instead focus on finding a partner who youre sexually compatible

’ s proven extremely dangerous we ’ ve seen driving players hit trees and at least two have even hit cop cars—one in baltimore and another in montréal httpkotakucompokemongopla so if you must catch ‘ em all in a car there are some things that can be done to mitigate the risk of crashing into police being charged with vehicular manslaughter or just being bad at the game here are some rules to follow rule no 1 don ’ t don ’ t just don ’ t let me say this again for good measure don ’ t i know there ’ s at least one or two of you out there who are thinking ha i am a multitasking god your mortal rules can not apply to me you can eat a cheeseburger with your knee as you put on makeup with your elbow and steer the car with your chin and you ’ ve done it before that ’ s the problem sponsored i tried catching pokémon while parked in a drivethru even then i felt dumb when i didn ’ t move up immediately because there was a poliwag in sight park somewhere where you ’ ll stay parked to catch pokémon pokémon go requires your full attention driving also requires your full attention yes there ’ s the augmented reality mode and you can leave that ar feature on to put pokémon on a backdrop of whatever ’ s in front of you problem is you ’ re then focusing on catching the pokémon instead of the background of reality the little suckers move around in ar mode too it ’ s one thing to walk around your apartment trying to catch a particularly jumphappy pokémon it ’ s much worse to do so while also trying to drive you can ’ t easily spin around in the driver ’ s seat if a pokémon darts sideways and it takes an absurd amount of your attention to follow them around anyway so keep it in park if you ’ re going to do anything in the game you can enjoy the comfortable seats luxurious cupholders and lifesustaining air conditioning of your car ’ s interior but don ’ t play the game itself unless your car is safely parked and out of the way of other traffic simply put p means play or if you have a manual transmission don ’ t even think about playing until you ’ ve yanked the parking brake parked to figure out my next move rule no 2 scope out your next pokéstop before going there the great thing about the pokémon go interface is that it gives you a map you can tap on further away gyms and pokéstops to see where they are before they ’ re in range and thus you can figure out where you ’ d like to go next without the app distracting you from the task of driving find a few points of interest write them down or put them in your car ’ s navigation unit then drive there driving is great when you park do so in a safe and legal location be sure to follow all applicable traffic and parking laws as you normally would rule no 3 leave your phone on but on silent and hidden one big downside to the game is that it has to be on and running to work or to log those brief moments where you ’ re traveling at low speeds more on this later this will drain your battery life fast according to anyone who ’ s ever played the game for more than 30 minutes fortunately most cars now come with power outlets so your car is bizarrely wellsuited for hunting pokémon

is tempted by phone sounds hide it in a cubbyhole out of sight out of mind if you know you ’ ll still somehow hear it vibrate turn off that function as well if you really have no selfcontrol stick your phone in the trunk i will say that my fear of becoming that guy who mowed down an entire median full of ornamental shrubberies while playing pokémon go has made me a less distracted driver with the game on gone is my temptation to glance down at text messages at stop lights i simply don ’ t want to interrupt the game or get caught using it behind the wheel one of many landmarks you ’ ll find as pokéstops in the game rule no 4 get out and walk around anyway i ’ m always looking for shortcuts so naturally the idea of tossing my phone in the trunk to run a few errands—or laps on a race track—to hatch an egg sounded like a solid plan nope the app was one step ahead of that idea after my roughly 48kilometer drive to test this idea barely netted any km towards egg hatching i wondered what was up turns out there ’ s a speed limit on what the game will log in terms of distance traveled while i couldn ’ t find the limit published on any official channels one unofficial source on quora claimed the app is limited to 20 kph—which sounds about right because you have to drive safely we don ’ t recommend puttering around at speeds slower than 20 kph on public roads that ’ s only about 12 mph for those of us not fully dedicated to the metric system 12 you would blow the fuse in your horn if you got stuck behind some jamoke doing 12 mph on a public road it ’ s still worth having the app on and hidden in your car as it will still log that brief bit of travel under 12 mph but don ’ t expect it to hatch eggs much faster there are better ways to cheat this after all some of which even involve the use of remotecontrol cars if you ’ re playing around cars make sure they ’ re going to stay parked for a while inside petrol lounge austin rather do what the game wants you to do get out and explore see your city ’ s landmarks if you have an egg to hatch drive to a park that has a few stops in it pick pokéstops that coincide with other errands you have to do my usual

innovative new veterans reintegration program last year johnson was one of more than 100000 soldiers leaving active duty army service every single one of them passes through fort knox before reentering the civilian world those army veterans are looking for jobs and communities where they can begin a new life as civilians the greater louisville kentucky area where fort knox is located has a vibrant cultural scene and growing economy in need of capable workers and young families visions of americagetty images the louisville kentucky skyline until recently however there was no coordinated effort to connect the soontobe civilians in fort knox with job opportunities and communal life in louisville so in september 2014 three regional chambers of commerce launched where opportunity knox to try to change that the program has the enthusiastic backing of the us army but it does not take a dime from the government it relies exclusively on funding from philanthropic foundations and it has already racked up some impressive numbers where opportunity knox claims credit for connecting 1500 veterans to jobs in the region already and it has the goal of navigating 10000 veterans to jobs in the greater louisville area by 2017 filling a void the transition to civilian life for soldiers being processed at fort knox has two stages according to retired col walter herd the director of the army ’ s transition assistance program preparation for a career outside the army and connection to opportunities in the civilian world the army spends two weeks on the first part herd said helping soldiers with everything from their own personal and psychological understanding to their budgetary needs culminating with a résumé and job preparation connecting those soldiers to a career and community is how where opportunity knox complements the army ’ s work representatives of the group are often on premises at training sessions in fort knox to assess soldiers needs and answer questions they advertise their availability to talk by email or phone on rallypoint an internal military professional networking site where opportunity knox emphasizes that it is not a job placement program it just gives veterans the personal support insight and connections to the employer community that they are less likely to find on say monstercom in addition to a team of several permanent staff members where opportunity knox uses a proverbial army of regional veteran connectors 35 trained volunteers to help veterans identify job opportunities in the region and a local community to live in that meets their needs the latter component means helping veterans identify everything from a quiet neighborhood to buy a home to educational services for children with disabilities to adult recreational sports leagues i ’ m excited about where opportunity knox because it connects them not just to a job but to a community retired col walter herd director army transition assistance program herd said there is no veterans reintegration program in the united states as comprehensive as where opportunity knox the army does not owe it to a soldier to get them a job but we believe we do owe it to a soldier to get them ready and get ‘ em introduced to something on the outside so they can at least begin that conversation herd said the preparation piece is the easy part the hard part is the connection piece i ’ m excited about where opportunity knox because it connects them not just to a job but to a community the feeling is mutual for kentucky ’ s business community where opportunity knox is a portal to a pool of reliable skilled workers that they say would otherwise be lacking as economic developers workforce is a challenge said eileen pickett an economic consultant and cofounder of where opportunity knox we have this ongoing problem and certainly now since we ’ ve gotten past the recession we ’ re starting to see growth and we need people with the right skills the population of the greater louisville area has grown 28 percent since 2010 in no small part due to its relatively successful recovery from the great recession unemployment in the louisville metropolitan area went from a peak of 119 percent in february 2010 to 4 percent today that is a better record than the country as a whole which went from a peak official jobless rate of 10 percent in october 2009 to 5 percent today daniel marans retired col walter herd is director of the armys transition assistance program the federal reserve bank of st louis points to the greater louisville area as a model for successful diversification of what was once a primarily industrial economy the city and surrounding areas now also boast a thriving service sector louisville proper is home to ups ’ worldport air hub as well as two ford production plants and the corporate headquarters of health insurance giant humana and while the city is known for its bourbon distilleries think maker ’ s mark woodford reserve and evan williams it is also the base of yum brands parent company of kfc pizza hut and taco bell army veterans are ideal candidates for the mid and highskill jobs that make the region ’ s businesses tick herd and pickett insist for one thing a person must be healthy free of a criminal record and have completed high school to get into the army in the first place soldiers then learn concrete skills in the army that often translate into civilian occupations everything from truck driving to supply chain management to computer science but more valuable than the skills the army teaches soldiers are the attributes that service instills herd said soldiers are virtually guaranteed to develop discipline a collaborative spirit and an ability to think on their feet before they emerge from fort knox ’ s walls to return to the civilian world and those are often the intangible qualities that make people reliable employees and innovators the military is pretty much a prescreening event for employers because all employers want the same people right they graduated school they ’ re healthy they stay out of trouble herd said so we take those people and we train them and discipline them and mature them and we steal them for a few years and then we give them back to society the military is pretty much a prescreening event for employers because all employers want the same people right they graduated school they ’ re healthy they stay out of trouble retired col walter herd director army transition assistance program the visit to an army base that inspired a new initiative pickett got the idea for the program after taking a group tour of fort irwin the army ’ s training center in california there she saw the lifesize replicas of entire towns in afghanistan and iraq that soldiers trained in before being deployed to war zones overseas it is the crucible that turns young highschool graduates into hardened adults ready to face unknown physical and mental challenges in a foreign nation what was so striking to me this was really my first kind of up close with the military i remember this captain who told us their job is to make every soldier that comes through there have their worst day in the service happen at fort irwin so it doesn ’ t happen somewhere else pickett said to pickett it was obvious that any soldiers that underwent training at that base let alone the experiences that followed would make for terrific employees and members of the community if they could make it through fort irwin wouldn ’ t they make a superb supply chain manager for ups i wish every american could go through there pickett said i was just inspired by it daniel marans eileen pickett an economic consultant cofounded where opportunity knox translating armyspeak to corporatespeak given how intuitively appealing these veterans sound as employees one would think veterans would have a relatively low unemployment rate but unemployment among young post911 veterans has been higher than among their nonveteran peers in 2014 the unemployment rate among post911 veterans was 72 percent compared with 6 percent among nonveterans for post911 veterans ages 18 to 24 the jobless rate was 162 percent compared with 125 percent among nonveterans of the same age the figures have since declined but on the advice of the bureau of labor statistics we are using annual data here for greatest possible accuracy the reasons are complicated the high incidence of posttraumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury among returning iraq and afghanistan veterans no doubt plays a role though that may be more due to employers ’ stigmas about the conditions than their actual effects there are other factors however that have more to do with the military ’ s separation from civilian society the networks that soldiers rely on to advance in the military often do not extend into the civilian world as a result it is hard to make professional connections with peers in the civilian world that are so essential to finding a job in today ’ s economy herd believes that departing soldiers are also sometimes unsure how to present the broader attributes they acquire in the military as professional assets in the civilian world the hard part comes in translating those skills from armynavyspeak to corporatespeak and explaining how military servicespecific skills are universally applicable kathy robinson founder turning point kathy robinson founder of turningpoint a bostonbased career counseling firm and a former human resources executive has worked alongside veterans recruited them to work for companies and advised them on finding work veterans bring a lot to the table when it comes to collaboration ability to assess a vision and execute on that vision when i was working with veterans they were often the most effective people in their jobs robinson said the hard part comes in translating those skills from armynavyspeak to corporatespeak and explaining how military servicespecific skills are universally applicable in fact those with the most easily translatable skills often have a harder time realizing the value of the attributes they have honed in the military let alone communicating them in terms employers can easily grasp herd notes that machine gunners and infantrymen who worked in positions that do not exist in the civilian world are less likely to be unemployed than army truck drivers who can easily become civilian truck drivers fred johnson fred johnson volunteers with healing and the arts to help younger veterans cope with ptsd you can actually see the community change johnson the army vet sees another challenge in the transition to civilian life like many veterans johnson wanted a job that provided him with a sense of purpose like the kind he enjoyed in the army given johnson ’ s worries about the applicability of his army skills in the civilian world altogether he did not think he would have the luxury of finding a job that fit that description that was before he met with the folks at where opportunity knox they told him about an opening at fund for the arts a louisville nonprofit that raises money for arts supplies and programs in louisville ’ s underprivileged schools johnson is now the organization ’ s director of workplace giving i had a certain idea in mind for what i wanted to do and they helped me work through that johnson said they helped me learn how to go through the civilian interview process i knew what i wanted and they helped me articulate that in a way that made sense through his work at fund for the arts johnson sees himself as part of a process of community building in the underserved west side of louisville he compares it to the reconstruction work he did in the iraqi city of baquba after the army brigade he led helped conquer it i tell them follow your heart not the money you can actually see the community change fred johnson army veteran and director of workplace giving fund for the arts when we attacked that city it was like a wasteland johnson said then we helped rebuild the city we are trying to do that here in louisville on the west side it is almost barren it almost reminds me of baquba in addition to the army instilling in him a desire to be a part of something greater than himself johnson said his service equipped him with communication skills and a comfort with diversity of all kinds both of those characteristics are assets to him in his fundraising work the vast majority of people in the army unless you don ’ t do your work who cares same thing with a female a gay person or any ethnic or racial minority johnson added the west side of louisville is very poor and racially diverse i fit in as well there as at humana or brownforman where everybody is wearing suits but johnson said he was also fortunate that fund for the arts was willing to give him an opportunity to prove himself despite his lack of formal fundraising experience and struggles with posttraumatic stress disorder from combat in iraq and afghanistan i told fund for the arts ceo christen boone this is what my ptsd means and this is what i am doing to overcome it johnson said i said i am bringing more positive baggage than negative she took a chance on me i wish more ceos and executives had the courage and prove himself johnson has local magazine business first recently named him one of louisville ’ s top 20 veterans in business now johnson is using his experience to help younger returning veterans find their way he volunteers with a joint civilianmilitary initiative called arts and healing the group uses art to help veterans cope with ptsd i tell them ‘ follow your heart not the money johnson said you can actually see the community change where opportunity knox helped give johnson the confidence that the skills he acquired in the army had prepared him well for a civilian career he explains to younger veterans that they too have attained those skills even if they do not yet know it a lot of time the younger kids do not realize what they ’ ve learned he observed they are 21 years old i say ‘ no dude you experienced a lifetime in that short span you just don ’ t realize how many tools you have ’',\n",

girl how to read before being ridiculed by residents of the town for doing so she held this impromptu lesson while doing her laundry rather than washing the clothes by hand belle attached a barrel to a mule and had the animal walk around in circles around a well creating a washing machine likely unseen before in the town in the original beauty and the beast the audience simply knows crazy maurice kevin kline as a widower and belle as his apparent caretaker it was never clear who belle ’ s mother was or what happened to her but thanks to the remake those questions have finally been answered with a little help from a magical book courtesy of the enchantress who cursed him the beast dan stevens and belle travel back in time to paris where belle was born the pair are transported into a tiny disheveled studio apartment with a view of a busy street it ’ s much smaller than belle imagined it ’ s here the beast tells belle what happened to her mother after spotting a doctor ’ s mask on the floor the beast concludes belle ’ s mother died from the plague a flashback between maurice and belle ’ s mom zoe rainey sick in bed saying their farewells proves this to be the case the woman tells maurice to take belle away so she doesn ’ t catch the disease as well so he does and the rest is history the beast was a rich prince pompous and entitled but he wasn ’ t always that way in the 1991 animated movie the audience assumes the beast was born like that his attitude simply accompanying the crown in the remake we found out that ’ s not entirely the case while belle asks mrs potts emma thompson and some others why they remain loyal to the beast they explain that they failed him when he was a boy the beast lost his mother at a young age and the castle staff said his cruel father kept him away from her while she was on her deathbed therefore they feel responsible for his behavior because they never protected him from his dad who they say turned him into a beast well before his physical transformation it ’ s true lyrics to one of the movie ’ s most popular songs gaston sounded a little different than the original while they were new to moviegoers beauty and the beast composer alan menken said they weren ’ t technically new they were simply unused lyrics by the late howard ashman that didn ’ t make the cut in the original film they ’ re not actually new lyrics they ’ re actually howard ashman ’ s that were outtake things menken told comicbook prior to the premiere in los angeles we had also put some of the outtake lyrics from howard in the broadway show and the reason that they hadn ’ t been used in the animated was that they were quite edgy for example the added lyric i hunt i sneak up with my quiver and i shoot in the liver was too edgy for an animated film but for this one menken said it was perfect unlike in the original the new beast is highly educated boasting about his expensive education while quoting shakespeare and critiquing belle ’ s admiration for romeo and juliet this is a sharp contrast from the original movie where a bored and seemingly illiterate beast needed belle ’ s help sounding out words in the books the beast is anything but bored with the books and agrees with belle that his huge library really is wonderful the beast doesn ’ t need any help reading a book and belle even catches his reading a romance alone in the garden at one point what happened to mrs potts ’ children chip ’ s brothers and sisters while chip nathan mack has always been front and center it was made clear in the 1991 movie that he wasn ’ t alone in the original film mrs potts told chip to join his brothers and sisters in the cabinet this time around chip tucked himself in within an empty cabinet late at night with no explanation as to whether he had any siblings we assume this time around he ’ s mrs potts ’ only child not cool gaston luke evans while trying to win the affection of his future fatherinlaw gaston pretends to believe maurice ’ s warning that a strange beast has taken his daughter belle captive so he and lefou josh gad take a horse and carriage out in the middle of the night asking maurice to lead the way when maurice approaches the path to the beast ’ s castle he discovers a tree that had been knocked down by lightning standing upright again gaston and lefou exchange glances implying that maurice has lost it and tell him it ’ s time to turn around but maurice refuses explaining that they should head toward the right gaston loses his temper with maurice and says he only entertained maurice ’ s wild story because he wants to ask for his daughter ’ s hand in marriage when maurice says that will never happen gaston realizes maurice will just get in his way so he knocks him out and ties him to a tree leaving him to the wolves lefou clearly uncomfortable with the idea of leaving maurice for dead pleads with gaston to reconsider but gaston pushes forward and returns to town without maurice little does he know maurice will beat him back to town telling locals the story about how gaston left him there to die if only they believed him the liveaction beauty and the beast remake made history by featuring disney ’ s firstever exclusively gay moment in the new film josh gad ’ s character lefou gaston ’ s best friend and confidant was presented differently than the 1991 animated version lefou is somebody who on one day wants to be gaston and on another day wants to kiss gaston director bill condon told attitude magazine he ’ s confused about what he wants it ’ s somebody who ’ s just realising that he has these feelings at one point in the film gaston asks lefou why he doesn ’ t have a lady lefou shrugs his shoulders and says he ’ s too clingy at the end of the movie lefou is dancing at a big celebration inside the castle with belle and the prince he starts out dancing with a woman but soon switches to partner with one of gaston ’ s henchmen who earlier in the film was pleased when the enchanted wardrobe dressed him in a puffy dress wig and makeup in the 1991 animated movie the beast has until his 21st birthday to break the curse in the remake there ’ s no set deadline he simply just has to find true love before the last petal falls referring to the enchanted rose and in the 2017 remake that last petal does fall and the beast who was shot by three bullets rather than by arrows and a knife dies as belle holds him in her arms on the balcony at that moment it appears the curse is final mrs potts chip lumiere ewan mcgregor and cogsworth ian mckellen slowly become inanimate objects and say their final goodbyes belle take a long pause before finally telling the beast she loves him as a tear slowly drips down her cheek behind her stands the transforming enchantress who originally placed the curse on the beast and his castle as she overhears belle ’ s last cry she lifts the curse bringing the beast back to life as a man and transforming all of the household objects back to their human selves the enchantress then disappears without a trace',\n",

high in calories along with a lack of physical activity causes an imbalance in metabolism which leads to obesity the tricky thing for many of us is getting the balance right and ensuring we maintain a healthy weight however the metabolism is not always an easy thing to understand and differs from persontoperson varying in efficiency and requiring differing amounts of energy to process the foods and drinks consumed wouldnt it be fabulous to be able to eat foods that can help you lose weight simply by eating them although this doesnt quite make sense on first reading you may be surprised to know that there really are foods that can help you do just that research suggests that there are some foods that may help manage weight by boosting the metabolism due to their thermogenic effect on the body in other words the amount of energy used and heat produced as your body processes this food all foods when consumed speed up the action of the muscles in the digestive tract using up energy and producing heat in the process this is known as thermogenesis however certain foods use up more energy and create more heat as the body burns calories the harder the food is to digest the more calories the body will have to burn to fully break it down before it can absorb the nutrients from it thermogenesis kicks in after every meal and the digestive process continue to burn calories many hours after a meal is eaten the thermogenic effect of food will depend upon the type of food and the amount of food consumed in the diet as a whole an effective weight loss programme can be modified to include some of these thermogenic foods to help you to achieve your goals but it is important to remember that this effect will only be achieved as part of a balanced diet with this in mind here are eight foods that can have a thermogenic effect on your body 1 chili peppers capsaicin a compound in chilli peppers stimulates the body to burn energy and create heat in our bodies white fat cells store energy and brown fat cells are thermogenic producing heat by burning fat a 2015 study suggested that increasing capsaicin in the diet may stimulate thermogenesis and also induce white fat cells to behave like thermogenic brown fat cells use fresh chilis chilli flakes or cayenne powder to add flavour to marinades and dressings or simply sprinkle liberally on your meals 2 whole grains and vegetables complex carbohydrates such as brown rice oats and quinoa also high in protein are high in dietary fibre that the gut can not fully digest and break down the extra effort the body has to put in requires extra energy burning its energy stores to digest these indigestible foods it is no surprise that any weight loss programme will encourage eating high portions of vegetables and in particular the leafy greens such as spinach rocket watercress kale and cabbage these vegetables are all high in insoluble fibre as with complex carbohydrates these will have a thermic effect on the body as more energy is used up in an attempt to digest these indigestible compounds so aim to reach your sevenaday of which five are vegetables and a maximum of two are fruits choose fruits with high fibre content such as apples or pears 3 black pepper piperine a compound found in black pepper has a thermic effect and can be responsible for the breakdown of some fat cells so reaching for the black pepper not only offers the benefits of its thermic effect but also adds extra flavour to your meal 4 ginger ginger also contains capsaicin responsible for its fiery flavour eating ginger fresh or powdered in your food can speed up the metabolism due to the increased heat production studies also suggest that ginger can reduce feelings of hunger and may help to manage weight use it in stirfries curries and marinades or try a warming ginger tea slice into thick discs and add hot water and allow it to steep for 10 minutes ginger can also be grated from frozen or stored in the freezer already sliced ready to use in a tea 5 garlic like ginger garlic with its fiery kick contains compounds that can enhance thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue use extra cloves if you enjoy the taste and include in marinades and dressings for a flavour boost 6 mustard mustard contains compounds found in other spicy foods and in particular capsaicin that not only gives it its characteristic flavour but also can also help to increase the body temperature when eaten add in a teaspoon of mustard to your salad dressing or include it in a casserole for added flavour 7 green tea studies show that both caffeine and catechin polyphenols micronutrients found in green tea can help to stimulate the metabolism boosting the number of calories used by the body therefore it can promote weight loss when combined with a healthy balanced diet and increased physical activity 8 protein when compared to fats and carbohydrates eating a meal high in protein has a bigger thermic effect proteins are complex nutrients and will require more energy to break them down as part of the digestive process for example if you eat a chicken breast containing 300 calories around 30 percent ie 100 calories will be burned during digestion research has shown that eating a high protein diet leads to lower weight gain in part also due to its positive effect on postmeal hunger and desire to eat always ensure good protein with every meal or snack not only for its thermogenic effect but also to help you stay full vegetarian protein sources include quinoa beans brown rice and lentils',\n",

              " 'Summarize:condition: 10 worthless collectibles and the reasons they lost their value paragraph: few myths are more common than the idea of collecting as an investment unfortunately for these ten examples the bust has come at one point or another most of us have daydreamed about finding buried treasure up in the attic whether its an old china set some dusty candlesticks or a copy of the declaration of independence theres always that hope that maybe up among the rubbish is something of real value just waiting to be discovered after all what could be better than a climate controlled treasure hunt that dream extends into collectibles from pogs to marbles to cabbage patch kids most of us tried to collect something at one point or another for a fewm the passion kept going until today a few folks have the kind of popculture artifacts that will amaze archeologists from future civilizations for the time being you can probably leave those shoeboxes where they lie though because the truth is that those old prizes rarely retain much value over time no matter how high profile most collections sooner or later become little more than old curiosities remnants of a fad that only really made sense in a specific time and a particular place yet perception often lags when it comes to many collections peoples belief in their value as an investment lingers long after that ceases to be true what drives the kind of passion that can send prices for laminated cardstock soaring and what can bring that tumbling back down to earth to understand that its helpful to look at ten collections that are worth less sometimes a lot less than many people think 10 cocacola memorabilia as jim griffith an antiquarian and the dean of education for ebay explained a few rules guide the price of collectibles first and foremost is the oldest of all supply and demand it would be a mistake he said not to ascribe to the collectibles market the general rule of market value historically that particular rule hit the market for cocacola collectibles hard back in the 1940s and 1950s america seemingly couldnt get enough of coke brand merchandise and the company obliged pumping out paraphernalia from clocks and coolers to more exotic fare such as the iconic gas station pumps and even flatware sets contrary to popular rumor however the smith wesson coke bottle grip was simply named after the shape not a marketing partnership prices soared for even the most mundane of items as collectors and novices alike grabbed every red and white tv tray they could this also brought prices tumbling back down when those collectibles were on the shelves of every single dime store in the country today the more elaborate pieces will still fetch a good price such as the vending machines listed for over 1000 but most of those cokestamped products are now just inexpensive curiosities available for 5 here and 10 there if the sellers lucky 9 americana with americana popular around the same time as cokebrand merchandise everyone can picture this midcentury craze smallville usa houses decorated from front to back with american flags and eagles in every shape size and permutation americana collectors slept under uncle sam sheets ate off of patriotic plates and hung their pictures in freedom frames today not so much the frenzy of buying american collectibles and american antiques from the mid and earlycentury definitely has taken a downturn griffith said as with virtually all collectibles the rule isnt absolute while prices will chase fads for most items the really high quality or unique pieces will always retain at least some of their value in fact for collections past their prime the truly valuable pieces may even go up in value as sets begin to fade away as marsha dixey consignment director with heritage auctions explained value of a collection has more to do with the run of the mill pieces than the truly outstanding ones collections become worthless she said when the majority of its pieces become little more than knickknacks that anyone can get what things dont have a value anymore that people think should she said is one of those things thats totally driven by the collector group thats no longer interested and has dropped out of the marketplace by the time 99 of the pieces are available to anyone who wants them it ceases to have value as a collection and instead is about singular artifacts 8 roseville pottery where supply and demand is as old as the concept of trade itself another major factor in eroding value is something brand new the internet its what wiped out collectors of roseville pottery and it will be back later on this list for years roseville pottery was a collecting craze while the company itself went out of business in 1954 rosevilles work continued to circulate gaining value over the years as its work grew in popularity whether acquiring pieces at antique shops or roadside dealers collectors prized every roseville find they could claim and as a result prices shot through the roof until the internet came along and put a stop to all that by taking the mystery out of the pot one of the things that ebay and the internet did was pull the cover off years of false scarcity in the market griffith said suddenly the actual supply situation was revealed prior to the internet and sites like ebay i could go searching in my car to different antique markets and shops and it was rare with the internet i could connect to every piece of roseville in the world what the internet revealed was how much prices depended not just on supply and demand but also on regional supply and demand a piece was as valuable as the supply of roseville pots that the buyer could find regardless of how many existed in the wide world when the local antique store has just two pieces in stock that can drive up some hard bargains when shoppers can go home and google up 800 more not so much 7 thomas kinkade paintings another success story brought low by the internet for a period of time in the 80s and 90s thomas kinkade the painter of light was absolutely everywhere now to a degree kinkades work was valuedriven his paintings are legitimately attractive sometimes downright beautiful and he was doing something with colors and warmth on canvas that didnt really exist in popular culture at that moment yet kinkade was a victim of his own success creating an entire company out of reprinting his paintings complete with dedicated franchise galleries across the country and a 110 million ipo in 1994 by its peak thomas kinkade signature galleries had 350 locations across the nation before its bubble burst in a slow collapse began in the early 2000s culminating in a bankruptcy filing in 2010 what happened a combination of the two factors weve already discussed market glut and the internet as kinkade flooded the country with his prints the value of the product in stores increasingly became an illusion prices represented how likely you were to find another kinkade around the block local scarcity as dixey put it not how much the piece was objectively worth the bubble would burst sooner or later and internet marketplaces did the trick once prospective buyers could reach the thousands of works that tks galleries had been pumping out for over a decade the rest was just a matter of time 6 hummel figurines most people have heard the name hummel before one of the most popular collectibles in american history hummel figurines are virtually synonymous with meticulously sorted rows of tchotchkes painstakingly assembled over the years hummel first started producing its porcelain figurines in 1935 after the drawings of a german nun maria innocentia hummel after gis returned from germany in the 1940s bearing gifts of these for their wives and girlfriends the collections began to catch on because there was enough scarcity to create a legitimate secondary market no one could go to the shop and just get another you had to hunt for what limited supply was out there over the course of the 20th century goebel the parent company that owned hummel decided to break that model endless special editions and limited runs proliferated all based on the proposition that pieces would continue to appreciate in value hummels were sold as an investment while the very act of selling them in bulk undermined the scarcity that made them valuable in the first place like with thomas kinkades work eventually buyers could readily find excess product either from the manufacturer or a flooded secondary market the value plummeted and today while some few retain their value most are little more than paperweights 5 comic books if flooded markets and the internet have dragged down collections value what causes it in the first place there must be some good reason why otherwise sane people shell out sometimes millions of dollars for a few colored pictures on musty paper the reason griffith explained has much to do with emotion it is often he said about a shared cultural moment collections especially pop culture or mass produced works are about the things we form an attachment to en masse hummel represented the end of the war years while thomas kinkade marketed his paintings to spaces where young couples would splurge on vacation a collectible is ultimately a personal decision that something has value far greater than the cost of its commodity and prices can shoot up when society decides to embrace that collectively there is no greater evidence of that griffith said than the explosion of the comic book industry into both collecting and media the idea now that our biggest blockbusters are all based on comic book heroes is not coincidental to the fact that todays audience were all comic book readers when they were younger unfortunately despite the impression many people have of lost riches in the paperbacks of their youth the reality is far more mundane aside from the highest value items comic book collections are worth next to nothing these days although dixey disagreed with that arguing that comic books are probably more solid than if you went out and purchased a very fine piece of chippendales furniture 4 commemorative plates for some reason in the midcentury the idea of memorializing shared moments on dinnerware became huge historians are still struggling to explain it nevertheless plates commemorating ideas such as the statue of liberty centennial the world series and norman rockwells paintings exploded as collectibles often fueled by qvc and latenight television the trouble is that with no one company acting as the gatekeeper for any of these products there was never any market scarcity to begin with unlike collectibles like hummel figurines whose manufacturer could have chosen to produce less plates such as centennial and norman rockwell collections were simply stamped out by any company that had a potential buyer although billed as a collectors item these are products that never had any real value to begin with today as the ebay listings show these are all but worthless with products such as the statute of liberty centennial plate selling for 099 and most norman rockwell ones going for 5 to 15 apiece 3 baseball cards cards are another quintessential collectors item today much of the collectors world has shifted to trading card games where the granddaddy of them all magic the gathering can still command enormous value a single card from that game can still fetch upwards of 30000 baseball cards on the other hand frequently disappoint its not that baseball cards have no value as long as the sport remains popular so too will its cards its that they have far less value than people assume while rare or exceptional cards can still fetch a bundle most baseball cards are worthless the disappointment settles in when people realize the difference between their expectations and reality those carefully hoarded collections from their youth stacked up pieces of cardboard tucked away and sat on for 20 years will fetch well maybe the price of lunch the reason goes back to cultural moments america simply doesnt have the love affair with its pastime that we once did when baseball resonated on an emotional level with almost everyone collectors could sell their cards to almost anyone and prices reflected that today as interested has waned so too has demand those cultural moments change very quickly griffith said if you think back it was a year or two ago the seth rogan movie the interview and all the brewhaha about sony pictures not releasing it that was an interesting cultural moment it popped up very quickly and then suddenly there were posters on ebay of this movie which looked like it may not be released which were selling for hundreds of dollars today those posters will go for a few bucks baseball fanaticism lasted a lot longer and may someday be back but for now few of those cards are much of an investment 2 beanie babies almost 20 years ago now beanie babies came along and it created a furor dixey said it started at a price point where people could afford to buy it and then it escalated dixey had a front row seat for the beanie baby explosion a brief fad america practically lived and died on beanie babies for a period of time in the late 90s for many millennials it stands out as the concept of collections as investmentsturnedjunk bond and today we still talk about the market for these little plush toys in awe the most expensive of which went for several thousand dollars as slates mark stern wrote of his own experience shopping for the plush toys in 1999 the britannia bear wasnt just a toy we explained it was an investment projected to be worth thousands of dollars within a decade our father capitulated and bought us each a britannia bear which we dutifully kept in mint condition with the tag intact reveling in its rarity while dreaming of the day it would be a hugely valuable collectors item one month later the company that developed beanie babies abruptly announced that it would stop producing the toys at the end of the year today the britannia beanie baby sells for 10 on ebay entire books have been written on the beanie bubble but suffice to say that unless youre sitting on one of the princess diana bears priced on ebay at an aspirational 343000 to 450000 that collection is worth maybe the gas money down to the salvation army 1 lunch boxes on the list of nice dreams add the idea that the old fraggle rock lunch box you used to use for ham sandwiches and gatorade might help send your kids to college now dispense with that notion altogether because no matter how fiercely some people might seek to line their walls with them these products just arent that valuable i had some experience oh 15 18 years ago with lunch boxes and bought and sold quite a number of them dixey said there were some that were indeed rare and they were bringing lots of money then all of a sudden some things started coming out of the woodwork dixey added you go back to the old adage of supply and demand all of a sudden theres a glut of them and it brings the price down one of the biggest questions in this space is consistently why people have such a mismatch between value and expectations part of it is simple lack of research but part griffith said is the very human habit of wishful thinking i did a lot of time in the 70s as a picker going around to different homes with another antique dealer looking for merchandise to buy and sell he said what was amazing to me was how many people thought that what they had was way more valuable than it really was and there was no real way to argue with them nothing

              " 'Summarize:condition: how to fix lag in ssb4 on 3ds paragraph: theres no denying that super smash bros 4 on the 3ds is a great game the release date brought a fighter with many characters lots of gameplay modes and frantic itemthrowing fun but nothings perfect in the case of smash bros 4 the mulitplayer lag is a huge issue whether it be local multiplayer in sm4sh or online the game stutters early and often the game is superb which is why it pains us that no matter what stage we choose our smash bros 4 fights always take place in lag city we got a hint of this when we did our review for ssb43ds but chalked it up to all other players being located halfway across the world in japan now that the games out in our country we thought our lag issues would be alleviated boy were we wrong now dont get us wrong we agree with louis ck the fact that we can play a video game with anyone around the world is amazing but smash is serious business despite being a fighting game the lag is pretty consistent so we quantified it smash bros super smash bros 4 lag online multiplayer we began our testing using both the for fun and for glory modes on the 3ds similar to when i played sm4sh for the review we experienced constant lag throughout gameplay during our for fun plays button presses were consistently between 30 to 40 milliseconds late not a huge amount obviously though certainly noticeable during our 3rd match during for fun while playing online using our home wifi network smash bros 4 decided to leave us indefinitely in the training mode just before the match begins were not sure if this was a network problem someone dropped off or just a glitch in the game without the ability to hit the home button we were forced to turn it off on to for glory then smash bros for glory saw lag go as high as 63 milliseconds after buttons were pressed though similar to for fun the lag was consistent if youre fine with pressing buttons twice just to make sure they register you can complete a match relatively trouble free smash bros ssb4 local multiplayer playing smash with our bros in person was a different story for some reason having everyone in the same room made our multiplayer lag experience worse than the online equivalent i and two others with the game sitting in a circle err triangle not more than 5 feet from each other ran into considerable lag when playing super smash bros 4 we played the game for nearly 3 hours using various characters and stages in a set of about 15 stages the first few went off without a hitch with the occasional hiccup the same couldnt be said for the second half of our marathon smash session 5 of the latter 7 matches lagged uncontrollably to the point where the loading spinner appeared on screen telling us to wait having one player completely lose all their stock lives with only 2 fighters remaining on screen didnt help the situation despite having never moved physically the rate of waiting for the throbber varied at times reaching 34 seconds in a 2nd round of local smash bros 4 multiplayer testing read playing in the office for science 2 players was much easier on the system the most lag we encountered occurred when 2 human players and a 3rd cpu player was thrown in the mix surprisingly 2 human players and 2 cpus resulted in no lag smash bros ssb4 online lag fixes and placebos having this much lag in a multiplayer game especially one like super smash bros 4 detracts from the overall experience though at least online the lag was consistent enough to get used to the sporadic nature of local multiplayers random loading dials and epic slow downs make more than 2 human player battles pretty annoying so guys found out i had lag because of my 3ds aluminum case smashbros pictwittercomwd5lw2pqns — raymond lancione raylancione october 7 2014 if anyones having smashbros lag online apparently it gets better if you plug in the charger while playing — it was me milu miluette october 6 2014 connectivity can depend heavily on location so i really don ’ t know what to say at the very least we ’ ve confirmed that smooth play is possible under various conditions of external networks during multiplayer you ’ re connected with another player and sending light amounts of data back and forth so if the game feels laggy it ’ s due to the connection speed if you play when it ’ s laggy then the person you ’ re playing with will experience the same lag so it ’ s best to play when the connection is clear during development there were cases where we had too many people and the connection became sluggish so we turned off our cell phones and the connection would clear up it ’ s best to avoid playing while streaming something or by a tethered connection free wifi spots are probably not very good either wordpress the part where i complain about the 3ds hardware something tells me the new 3ds was made because the current one cant handle super smash bros this is the first time a smash game has been made available for handheld and already weve seen reports of broken circle pads and awkward control schemes the 3ds charger improving the online performance likely hints at the processing power of nintendos hardware likely holding back in an effort to save battery life not to mention og 3ds owners not getting access to the beloved cstick nintendos hardware always lags behind the competition but theyve been able to get around it by bringing us great games but what happens when even your own killer first party title doesnt run properly on yesterdays hardware you swore by would the ps vita have these lag issues could the ice climbers have part of smash bros for the iphone not that you could ever seriously play smash on a smartphone but not the point though all in all smash players now that the 3ds version isnt the real experience having the game with us at all times is nice but the real showdowns will take place on the wii u in hd and with gamecube controllers in hand if nintendo can bring a smooth experience to the full edition of super smash bros 4 fans may be likely to forgive the gaming company are you experiencing lag

              " 'Summarize:condition: things in the olsen twins lives that make no sense paragraph: it kind of goes without saying that any hope for a normal life gets dashed for people who become millionaires before they can even walk but marykate and ashley olsen who famously portrayed michelle tanner on the smash sitcom full house cranked the dial on their wacky personal lives all the way up to 11 with everything from their strange dating preferences to some questionable business practices to marykates stillunexplained connection to the death of heath ledger the olsen twins have led bizarre lives since leaving the tgif lineup though theyve found massive success in an entirely separate business — the fashion world and theyve also become increasingly reclusive and they dont smile but were getting ahead of ourselves here theres a lot to unpack when it comes to the mysterious world of the olsen twins so lets dive right in and find out just how peculiar marykate and ashleys lives have become banking on bad movies yeah marykate and ashley made a lot of money splitting the role of michelle tanner on full house 19871995 but they continued to rake in beaucoup bucks when the popular sitcom ended their net worth in 2018 was an estimated 400 million combined how have these child stars remained rich when so many of their peers have struggled the twins earned much of their fortune making unintentionally laughable directtovideo movies — 45 to be exact according to elle their most famous film new york minute 2004 earned a dismal 11 percent rating on rotten tomatoes – and the bulk of those percentage points are probably owed to costar eugene levy — yet none of that stopped the movie from collecting more than 21 million worldwide its the same for much of their video oeuvre which was largely ignored by critics however their 1995 collaboration with steve guttenberg and kirstie alley it takes two did garner enough attention to pull in 8 percent rating on rotten tomatoes in spite of all the critical panning elle claims that the twins film career raked in a startling 750 million dollars call us crazy but wed trade in every bad review ever written in exchange for that kind of scratch the marykate heath ledger connection it seems to have been forgotten over the years that marykate was somehow linked with actor heath ledgers death in 2008 while there was never any suggestion of foul play marykates name was involved from the moment the dark knight stars body was discovered when ledgers masseuse found him unconscious in his new york city home the first person she called was marykate twice instead of 911 according to the daily mail when the masseuse finally determined she should reach out to the authorities marykate sent over her security team who arrived at ledgers flat at the same time as the ambulance stranger still multiple news sources reported that marykate refused to talk to federal investigators about ledgers death unless she was granted immunity why was she so concerned about being implicated for something did it have anything to do with ledgers accidental overdose on prescription pills her attorney michael c miller denied she had anything to hide marykate olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them miller said in a statement marykates stonewall tactic eventually worked when the dea and federal prosecutors closed the inquiry into ledgers death in august of 2008 the us attorney of the southern district decided not to serve olsen with a subpoena a source told the new york daily news which effectively let olsen off the hook for any further speculation opioid crisis what opioid crisis the olsens are now successful fashion designers with multiple clothing labels to their name the twins offer everything from affordable childrens clothing all the way up to haute couture and while they kicked off their careers with threads sold exclusively at walmart they really shot to the top of the catwalk when they unleashed a 55000 pillcovered handbag associated with their label the row in 2012 thats right these two helped create a black crocodile leather backpack covered with prescription pills and called it high fashion according to entertainment weekly the musthave accessory for the fashionable pharma rep was the result of a collaboration with artist damien hirst whose pillcentric work was previously featured in some of his other installations called pill cabinets so you should be sensing a theme here is what were getting at at any rate this ghastly accessory celebrating drug culture seems even more offensive considering marykates rumored connection to the celebrity drug scene not to mention ledgers overdose on prescription drugs the good news they only made 12 of them so not only were their illgotten earnings likely capped at 660000 which lets be honest is a drop in the bucket to their nearly half billion dollar fortune but also theres a good chance youll never encounter one of these abominations strapped to someones back in real life marykate looksdifferent for most of their adult lives the olsen twins looked like younger pintsized versions of cameron diaz but around november 2014 people began noticing just how different marykate looked compared to her younger self and her fraternal twin sister naturally the plastic surgery rumors flew with some gossip sites even claiming ashley had altered her appearance too in 2017 the plastic surgery chatter kicked into high gear again after the olsens showed up to the met gala above where marykate once again bore the brunt of the speculation it should be said however that the tabloid life style did its best approximation of due diligence when it consulted with a plastic surgeon who hadnt treated either twin about possible work marykate had done his conclusion smoking andor bad makeup and lighting is to blame for her gaunt face mystery solved the ladies rarely talk about their personal lives and have certainly not fielded questions about cosmetic surgery but dont worry because unethical plastic surgeons who are willing to speculate on patients theyve never treated just to get their name mentioned in a national publication are never in short supply olsens to paltrow hold our beer the olsen twins were asked by elle to recommend some christmas gift ideas in 2014 perhaps unsurprisingly they exclusively suggested items from their boutique los angeles shop the row the real shock came with the sticker prices on some of the items or more accurately the lack of prices since everything was listed as price upon request whatever that means expensive it means very expensive exactly how much do the olsen twins expect someone to pay for a rare van cleef lighter or a deck of vintage playing cards well probably never know but we feel that we should point out that versions of both of those things can be purchased at virtually any convenience store for around 1 are the items in their shop actually worth their mysterious but surely exorbitant prices or are the olsen twins just trying to give gwyneth paltrow and her annual goop gift guide — with its similarly marketpriced personal submarine — a run for its money fuller house remains one pair shy portraying michelle tanner on full house was undeniably the starting point for all of the olsen twins fame but when the cast signed on to be in the sequel series fuller house the olsen twins were the only ones to decline while its understandable that they want to take their lives in a different direction it doesnt seem too much to ask for the olsens to at least make a cameo as a nod to the fans and costars that cemented their lives of leisure and luxury the reclusive duo did sort of share its reasons for skipping the reunion according to show producer bob boyett ashley said i have not been in front of a camera since i was 17 and i dont feel comfortable acting and marykate said it would have to be me because ash doesnt want to do it but the timing is so bad for us amazingly full house and fuller house creator jeff franklin doesnt consider the snub a burned bridge although he did tell us weekly that after three years of rebuffed invitations to join the show hes done asking but when somebody rings a doorbell the girls yell its always open on the show franklin said adding so thats kind of how we feel about the olsen twins the door is open elizabeth olsen is no long lost twin actress elizabeth olsen took a bit longer than her older sisters to breakout as an actress — 21 years to be exact but taking time before diving into the acting world isnt the only difference between elizabeth and the twins where marykate and ashley are reclusive and cagey elizabeth is outgoing vivacious and comes off like an extremely welladjusted regular person who just happens to act really really well baby sisters resume also creates a significant difference between her and her sisters elizabeth never dabbled in cheesy tween fare she went straight to criticallyacclaimed indies such as martha marcy may marlene 2011 then on to megahits such as godzilla 2014 the avengers age of ultron 2015 and captain america civil war 2016 elizabeth is also no stranger to the red carpet and interviews and she displays a remarkable savvy about how to navigate alist fame while maintaining her personal life it comes quite easily she told vogue i dont know if that comes from growing up in la and having so many examples around me all the time its something that i watched people doing well growing up clearly she wasnt referencing marykate and ashley who famously and hilariously failed at hiding from the paparazzi so often that artist laura collins created a whole exhibit around their antics we know were going to sound like nagging parents here but seriously marykate and ashley would it kill you to be a little more like your sister marykates kool wedding there are few details about the notoriously pressshy marykates wedding but like many things in the eccentric twins life one tidbit leaked from the nuptials left everyone scratching their heads page six reported that a source said there were bowls and bowls filled with cigarettes and everyone smoked the whole night which is bizarre especially since it took place in manhattan where for years smokers have been shunned into shameful huddled groups as far away from the general public as possible then again marykate married olivier sarkozy a french billionaire so maybe the cigs and the laissezfaire attitude sort of do make sense but what about the other details page six also reported that guests of which there were only 50 were required to turn in their cellphones before a cocktail reception and indoor dinner at a private residence on 49th street between second and third avenues actually that all seems completely in line for a woman who once said weve stayed quite sheltered okay fine that was ashley but you get our point they are living pop culture artifacts after becoming enamoured with the few details surrounding marykates wedding olsen enthusiasts viviana olen and matt harkin decided to open a popup museum dedicated to the strange public persona of the twins according to a 2016 story in the huffington post the venue mostly features paintings of paparazzi photos of marykate and ashley hiding their faces but it also has other wacky features like a phone that only takes calls from candace cameron bure offering parts on fuller house and a recreation of marykates wedding tablescape of cigarettes theres definitely a tongueincheek aspect to the attraction which is why the curators have also published a companion magazine which is basically just photos of the paintings with funny captions here we see an olsen coming to one of two realizations that she will have to close a car door herself for some reason or that her outfit only works sitting down hopefully the olsen twins are

clothing store ashley admitted she has never purchased anything online while marykate bought something once at an online auction were just going to assume it was a jesse the rippers cd autographed by john stamos because thats the only way well feel like these ladies are somewhat relatable humans after reading about their ridiculous store the times story includes the following descriptions about their boutique they convinced masa takayama the renowned sushi chef to sell them his ceramics and indeed the store feels more like a tastefully appointed manse than a traditional retail shop its individual rooms decorated with marquee art a basquiat here a borge jorgensen sculpture there and significant furniture cool so were guessing no clearance rack right how about layaway because if we can do 5 on that jorgensen well totally be back next week with the rest did they build a billiondollar brand on the backs of overworked interns former intern shahista lalani spearheaded a class action lawsuit against the olsen twins dualstar entertainment group after she felt her duties went beyond the acceptable scope of an internship according to page six lead plaintiff lalani and about 40 interns past and present claim they were treated poorly and not compensated for their extremely long hours though lalani admits the olsen twins were nice during her brief encounters with them she feels the company the twins built did not handle its interns properly and she has a point how do coffee runs data entry or making photocopies educate students who are volunteering their time to learn about fashion design according to court documents obtained by radar the twins tried to reach a confidential settlement with the plaintiffs which would have ostensibly allowed them to avoid the publicity of a trial and the additional shady dealings it may uncover but in march of 2017 the terms of the settlement were made public and the olsen twins agreed to pay 140000 to the approximately 180 present and past interns who were eligible according to e news after legal fees that leaves a whopping 530 per intern who allegedly wasted their entire internship on mundane office work and didnt learn anything about fashion how rude',\n",

got that one that we just hate purely because it looks like something they let the work experience kid draw on a friday evening when nobody else could be bothered i can guarantee you it didn ’ t take a whole day to design a ditto did it so we ’ ve trawled through all six generations of pokemon to find the ones that are just bad designs who ever came up with some of these needs to share what they ’ re smoking klefki so we ’ ll start with the pokemon that inspired me to write this article because it ’ s a bloody key ring for klefki it might be quite convenient you ’ d never lose your keys because they are part of your body but it does absolutely nothing for me in the design department there are a couple more pokemon like this where it seems as though the design team have sat in the office playing eye spy until they find an object they could attach a personality to it and of all things they chose a bunch of keys each to their own rotom i ’ m trying to get my head around this one because it ’ s just such a strange concept the description of rotom on bulbapedia yes pokemon wiki goes as follows so it just turns into white goods whenever it feels like it purely for the purpose of changing it ’ s power type it just astounds me that stuff like this manages to get all the way to the game and tv series without anybody going hang on has anyone else realised this pokemon is pointless but it keeps happening luvdisk this pokemon that i could get on board with if it hadn ’ t been drawn by what appears to be an underimaginative child the concept is pretty nice it ’ s a watertype pokemon with a fishlike appearance shaped like a heart so much more could have been done with that brief than what we ’ ve got there ’ s no fins or seemingly anything that could be used to propel the creature through water and the supernecessary circle below the eye is almost laughable the lost potential of this pokemon has landed it on my list unknown unown the flying alphabet which seemingly has little functions apart from the ability of flight and group telepathy but there ’ s 28 of them regardless including a question and exclamation mark again this feels like a feeble attempt to introduce a new pokemon with not much thought put into it i ’ m just waiting for the generation where they ’ ll add a mysterious set of number pokemon which is seeming increasingly likely vanilluxe another one of my favourites because it ’ s just so awful yes as you can see above it ’ s an icecream cone the designers thought this ice pokemon was such a good idea in fact that vanilleuxe is the third evolution after vanillite and vanillish to be featured in the game i find this one lazy because they ’ ve added a scoop of icecream to resemble the evolution similar to dugtrio dodrio etc and because it was a terrible ide to begin with and they ’ ve managed to scrape three new pokemon out of it jynx what even was this supposed to be in the first place a terrifying largebosomedwomanhood made for mankind jynx makes my list for being just plain creepy cofagrigus another one of those that ’ s just a bit why it ’ s a haunted coffin with four black spaghetti arms and a face on its forehead all in all it just looks a bit silly in its description on bulbapedia it says the pokemon lives in ruins and can swallow up nearby people well now i ’ m scared voltorb the award for the laziest pokemon design ever has to go to voltorb this electric pokemon resembles something pretty similar to another element of the game – it ’ s just a pokeball with eyes dedenne dedenne earned its place because it ’ s so obviously a failed attempt to recreate the muchloved logo and everyone ’ s favourite pikachu everything down to the bright cheeks and zigzagged tail screams cheap imitation – and nobody can replace our pika druddigon award for the most poorly drawn dragon pokemon goes to druddigon the colours are pretty nasty and i reckon those blue leaves that are supposed to be wings wouldn ’ t hold the rest of the weight i kind of feel sorry for him being so awkward and all looking like charizard ’ s unloved cousin can ’ t be all that much fun exeggutor it ’ s quite hard to understand what exeggutor is all about considering its predecessor is a row of eggs with a name that connotes to eggs and then it evolves into some coconut tree what how does that happen i ’ ve never heard of coconuts hatching from eggs but in the pokemon world anything seems possible garbodor it ’ s pretty hard to pick the worst of the list as you can imagine but i think i ’ ve found it in garbador it ’ s a literal pile of rubbish from an overflowing black bag yeah you read it right the first time its preevolution is just a bin bag not quite yet full enough to split how do they get away

because for years i suffered with acne and for years i let my mental health take over ruin relationships stop me going out ect all because i was insecure and worried about other peoples opinions because lets be honest acne isnt nice to look at i knew i couldnt carry on being this hard on myself to the point i would cry and have a lot of built up stress causing headaches i thought about the days when i used to have no worries when i was younger and heres what i came up with i wasnt living life trying to impress anyone i wore no makeup so never felt less beautiful i didnt spend my time trying to make myself look perfect i didnt sit at home comparing myself to others on instagram its the world we live in today that makes us think like this i dont want young girls feeling the same way

however in some of her most recent posts crawley ’ s skin has significantly cleared up and for that she credits one simple diet change after experimenting with taking certain foods out of her diet she found that sugar and carbs appeared to be the main culprits for her aggressive bouts of acne i just wanted to share with you all a little study that i found out its not proven but you know it made me feel better 😅 so apparently acne sufferers skin cells take slower to age less wrinkles and younger looking skin obviously this may not be true but you never know something good always comes out of
